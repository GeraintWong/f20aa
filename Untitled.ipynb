      "So the delays were more than likely as a result of air traffic control, not the airline. And then Sydney Airport has a curfew which means no flights can land or take off during certain times, so the crew for the plane likely wouldn’t be able to wait six hours or their sign on time would have expired. So your anger should be more placed toward Sydney Airport and the NSW government.\n",

      "Yes we have a curfew but honestly Sydney has had a bunch of storms recently. Good chance the little bit of rain also included lightning.

Even if the lightning wasn't at the airport itself if it's close enough they will still restrict.\n",

This was all because of the storms you mention (and the weather was fairly crazy). I just question though, other cities operate during rain and lightning. I didn't realise ground staff weren't permitted on the tarmac if there's lightning, thanks for that. Wonder if that's consistent around the world or an over-cautious Aus thing?\n",

I had a quick google and it seems other countries also have similar rules when lightning is within 5 nautical miles or something.\n",
