So many horror stories of flights retimed several hours resulting in passengers missing connecting flights, in some cases losing hotel bookings on planned holiday.

They don't give you food, extra leg space, or check in baggage, just to keep costs low. No other flight offers prices as low as theirs. RM29 from KL to Langkawi? RM19 from Kuching to KK? RM160 to Bali? If you want add-ons and you can afford it or fly other airlines, good for you. But for a budget traveler who wants to fly, good for them. \n",

      "Their taxi time is about 20 minutes, meaning people get off once they land, new passengers get on board and they go to their next destination. They save costs because pilots  & cabin crew don't have to stay at the destination. Because of the tight schedule, if anything goes wrong, it's a domino effect for all their other flights. \n",

I utilize this feature for holidays, I'd book on a week close to public holidays and prepare myself for that week. If there's a flight change and I am given a free reschedule, I'll move my flights to the dates of the public holiday, FOR FREE. If you try to book flights on the same day, it will usually be 3-4x more expensive. I get to save my AL in this case. If you still want to travel on your initial dates, just choose a different time on the same day. And all these are easy to do via the chat bot. \n",

During a sale, they were selling Krabi return tickets for RM190. I refunded my RM160 and added RM30 for a flight to Krabi instead. I booked the flights for a weekend in the end of March. Few months before that flight, they moved the time. I then changed my dates to the songkran festival, an experience I always wanted to try. It was always more expensive to fly on Songkran dates, but with my free flight change, I managed to go for a really low price. \n",

After 3 months, no momey, asked them, they said I did not agree to refund fee, so no request made. Showed them screen shot, they created new request again. After again 3 months, no money, ask CS they said ticket already closed and told me to check with bank. Wtf straight away I scold them I already checked with bank, they say they create request again. I emailed Philippine Ministry of Transport, they emailed Philippine Airline to expedite the request. Then CS emailed me said \"because of FPX limitation, cant transfer back to card, have to fill in waiver form\". Again, I scold them through email because they did not inform me on that before they closed my previous ticket. Checked the email, they removed ministry of transport email from cc list. I put back, and told them not going to wait for 3 more months. \"We will ensure to process it faster\".\n",

      "\n",
      " 2. AA frequently breaks the law to get free money from me; charging you for paying using your card is illegal, but since they only get slapped with fines marginally fewer than they gain—a few thousand while they get millions—it's just a cost of operation for them. Pay using a card; they want free money. Pay at the counter; they also want free money. Go fuck yourself, Tony.    They charged you for paying them, what an absurd scummy thing to do.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Personally I was in the same boat, I had flights booked with AirAsia before covid and I received credits, I just used those credits when flights opened up again, I believe those credits were valid for 3 years, more than enough time to book new flights when the world opened up again, though obviously flights were more expensive then since everyone wanted to travel again after 2 years of closed borders.\n",

      "\n",
      "Their cabin crew are also a mixed bag. The junior FAs which makes up the bulk of FAs on AK seem to be there just to enjoy and not take their job seriously. On one flight, I noticed a passenger asking for assistance for connections at KLIA, the FA simply just shake her hands while appearing clueless without asking for her to refer to the ground staff for help. On the other hand, on D7 which tend to have senior FAs, the cabin crew are more helpful and professional. The last time I flew with them to Hokkaido, they were very attentive. Though that maybe in part due to my dad being a pilot for them so the crew know him hence the special treatment. But I can say the cabin crew on D7 seem to take their job seriously unlike AK.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in general, AK and by extension, D7 can be either good or bad depending on your luck. But I can say they really suck on ground staff, communication and for most people, refund. But on the air, it can be quite decent for an LCC. The F&B selection at least help make up their flaws.\n",
