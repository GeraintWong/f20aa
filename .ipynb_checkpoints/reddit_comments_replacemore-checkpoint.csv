https://www.reddit.com/r/AirAsia/comments/1ir60jp/question_about_checkedin_luggage/,Question about checked-in luggage,"Make sure your bags are fully tagged… like buy two external luggage tags with your name, email, phone. Also put a sheet of paper inside the bags, again, with your information. I highly advise you to make sure you have delayed bag insurance, and lost bags insurance. Air Asia lost my bag - it was worth $1,500 usd. But they only offer 20 USD per Kg. For my bag they only offered 260 USD. By the way, they did not honor the delayed bag insurance, bc they said the bag was lost not delayed. So, make sure you buy both. It won’t cost too much, and in case they lose your bags - you can possibly get a more fair and ethical recompense.",0,

Can you use those? I have not been successful getting a boarding pass after the flight itself. — EXCEPT. When I flew Emirates. They were able to provide it. Air Asia is a budget airline which means they do not offer certain services. It is how they keep their operating expenses low, and profits high. Let us know if you are successful and how it went. From my perspective, I was not able to get it.",0,
