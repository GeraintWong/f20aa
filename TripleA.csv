Review,Sentiment
Ive flown with them dozens of times and never had any major issues,Positive
Ive flown AirAsia Thai AirAsia and AirAsia Philippines and never had an issue,Positive
I have flown with them several times and never had any problems They do weigh the bag in Thailand and Malaysia though Didnt weigh in Denpasar and Singapore,Positive
Within Thailand I have good experiences with them I flew air Asia x to Japan and it was really bad Cabin staff was honestly nice but ground staff was awful and rude,Negative
Same experience with AirAsia Japan,Negative
I almaot always use AirAsia when flying around SE Asia and have never had any issues Good prices cheap addonsseats food baggage etc rarely delayed and I have never had an issue with them weighing Once I was even over by a kilo or 2 and the guy told me not to worry about it They do have an option to pay more so you can carry on 14 kilos as well if you want Also I have had issues using a foreign card on other airlines but never an issue on airasia,Positive
So far ok for me but they play incredibly terrible songs during boarding and departure make sure to get some noise cancelling headphones or ANC,Positive
Thieving bass still owe me a 1000 usd I will never see again I guess They do blitz bag weights saw that last time I flew from Indonesia the poor sods on an Air Asia flight had a long queue,Neutral
Airasia and Batik air are decent airlines My only issue is the no headphones for taxitakeoff Other than that paying a little extra for the first row is fantastic value,Positive
I’ve been traveling for around two years and have spent most of the time in SEA so I’ve flown AirAsia a lot and I’ve never had any issues either The music always gives me a good laugh too I was on a flight in Thailand recently that was playing Let It Snow,Positive
I‘d say based on nearly 20 years of flying AirAsia they’re better than most European budget airlines Of course stuff happens with luggage and delays sometimes but that happens with any airline if you fly enough,Positive
Only thing I hate is they don’t have portsoutlets to charge your phone lol yes I’m petty Other than that they’re pretty chill,Positive
Ive flown with them dozens of times throughout the year and no issues,Positive
Never had any issues with Air Asia in fact it’s one of our preferred carriers we are based near DPS Weighing bags and having passengers comply with carry on limits is a positive But in SE Asia it’s less of a factor compared to the US because most folks don’t try to bend the rules,Positive
If I have to fly budget Id rather scoot plus With the strict carry on rules old planes and horrible service AA is a last resort for me Ive flown them to KL a few times without incident though,Negative
No issues,Positive
I have stopped flying airasia after the plane crashed 10 years time flies,Negative
M35 and travel a lot for work all over the world Time’s a big deal for me and honestly I’d say I prefer AirAsia compared to other LCCs I don’t really get the complaints people post online The food is awesome yeah you pay extra but at least there are plenty of options and the prices aren’t bad Delays Yeah they happen I remember being stuck in SG once for over 3 hours because of a delay missed my connecting flight too They gave some compensation—not much but at least they owned up to it Honestly that’s just air travel especially with LCCs It’s kinda fun if you like the challenge haha,Positive
A Disappointing Experience with AIR ASIA The Worst Airline Flying with Air Asia has been without a doubt one of the most frustrating and unpleasant travel experiences I have ever had 1 Booking and Customer Service The booking process was a nightmare Their website was riddled with glitches It took multiple attempts to complete a simple reservation and each time an error occurred it was difficult to determine what had gone wrong When I finally resorted to calling their customer service I was met with long hold times Once I got through to an agent they seemed ill informed and unhelpful They were unable to answer basic questions about baggage allowances and seat selection which were not clearly stated on their website either 2 On Board Experience The aircraft itself was in a sorry state The seats were uncomfortable and cramped with very little legroom The upholstery was worn and had visible stains in several places The in flight entertainment system was malfunctioning on my flight The touchscreen was unresponsive and the selection of movies and shows was extremely limited compared to other airlines 3 Food and Beverage There is not served food during in flight they sell the food during your flight During the flight there are announcements on speakers and sell goods as well as food like some cheap street vendors 4 Flight Delays and Communication This airline has a reputation for flight delays and my experience was no exception Our flight was delayed by over three hours and the communication from the airline about the delay was almost non existent There were no clear announcements about the reason for the delay or any estimated departure time Passengers were left in the dark waiting around aimlessly in the terminal In conclusion I would not recommend AIR ASIA to anyone Their lack of attention to detail poor customer service and sub standard on board experience make them in my opinion the worst airline in the industry,Negative
The issue is that if you do have an issue with them they have almost no customer support Just some useless AI bot named Bo My flight today is delayed 25 hours which means Ill miss my connecting flight and then also the ferry to get home They wont help me at the airport and theres no way to contact a human Smh,Negative
Dogshite airline,Negative
Philippines air Asia has delayed our flights twice and now the second time is late too No service max problems,Negative
AirAsia is fine if you want to get the job done If you encounter any problems however strong chance it will turn into a horror story I remember reading a post somewhere saying that AirAsia is a pyramid scheme and honestly it kind of is lol From my experience their customer service is basically nonexistent like it took half a day for me to talk to someone they were super strict with the bag weighing and a bunch of hidden costs Especially with their customer service my flight got delayed and it was the worst experience Ive ever had with an airline,Positive
Ive flown them a few times And their legroom absolutely sucks Its like its been design for children Im 61 so on the taller side but not super tall Although for Asia very tall And those Air Asia seats are the most uncomfortable as your knees are pushed into the seats in front usually into some hardmetal bit So would be in agony after half an hour I would always have to travel emergency exit with them to have any sort of slight comfort But other than that I never had any issues with the actual flightsweighting bags Jetstar on the other hand I would avoid unless its absolutely the only option had to pay to check in overweight hand luggage at the gate they went around weighing them Then emptied my bag as it was all camera gear into a plastic bagpokctes And checked in an empty bag Still taking on a overweight plastic bag and being a huge pain,Negative
My crazy experience with AirAsia was in KL where they werent letting us enter the immigration queue if our carry on weighed 7kg They told us to checkin our bags so we complied and stood in the queue for around 30 mins and finally they asked us to step aside didnt give us any reason closed the counter So we decided to wear some of our clothes and shift some stuff in our laptop bag hoping that we could make it The bags weighed 8kg so we were again denied entry Ultimately were took out a plastic bag and put some stuff in there They let us go in Once we were in we put everything back in the carry on suitcase Everyone did this Some people were carrying one suitcase and 45 shopping bags We spent more than an hour here Thankfully we were 4 hours early to the airport so we had plenty of time It was super weird They werent checking for any extra bags but only cared about one suitcase being 7kg,Negative
I got this in Brunei around 8kg and the ground staff refused to check me in unless I paid Went to the bathroom and put on all the clothes I could stuffed my pockets full even laptop charger and managed to make it through Have never had any problem and rarely weighed jn KL although Ive flown sooo many times with them,Negative
AirAsia Philippines is crap Avoid it at all cost They reschedule flights 1 day before the departure If you have a connecting flight it is so stressful and a pain in the head I wouldn’t recommend AirAsia here,Negative
They’re a budget airline but I’ve flown them a handful of times and never had any problems adjust your expectations accordingly I’m presuming the price of the ticket reflects their low cost nature It depends on your flights are they operated by AirAsia or AirAsia X,Positive
It’s a low cost carrier You get what you pay for My flight with them was fine,Positive
Ah very bad for long flights You have to pay extra for everything including access to a USB port to charge your phone If you have money dont use them I took a long flight and their internet wasnt working Everything even the most basic things cost more Their policy also says no food allowed from outside Which is insane,Negative
Yes Its a low coast carrier So no IFE Thats not the worst The legroom is the main problem the staff is ok They gonna take you to your destination that is the post important thing right,Neutral
My review for AirAsia is DO NOT USE I tried to make a booking for a flight from Kathmandu to Bangkok on September 23 money was taken out and nearly instantly confirmed as booking failed It is now December 19th and I still haven’t received my refund They claim that they can’t refund the money because a third part airline was involved because they don’t have my card information because I don’t respond fast enough to emails This is entirely AirAsia’s fault not mine and they cannot seem to do anything When I first tried to get information the chat robot “Bo” was utterly useless and has been from the start of me using this app and when I finally did get a representative they were not much better I asked for credit when they said they had problems refunding the money as I still needed a flight but they said AirAsia doesn’t due credit However I know that to be a lie as I have people who have confirmed AirAsia gave them credit to fly and looking online most reviews mention getting credit for another flight not refunds For fellow travelers I understand that you may not have many options for airlines especially if you are in SE Asia this is one of the most common So if you must use AirAsia my advice is DO NOT use them for long flights and DO NOT trust them as a third party representative Only book AirAsia with AirAsia If something goes wrong they will not help you,Negative
DEFINITELY NOT A pain in the ass A stressful company to do business with,Negative
I would not travel by Air Asia food is very limited and seats are cramped even the so called business class does not provide the service that one would expect in respect of meals and entertainment,Negative
LONDON 25 June 2024 – AirAsia has been recognised as the World’s Best LowCost Airline at the Skytrax World Airline Awards 2024 marking a historic 15th consecutive year win This unparalleled achievement is driven by AirAsias relentless pursuit of innovation and value creation within the lowcost carrier segment Sourcehttpsnewsroomairasiacomnewsairasiaisskytraxsworldsbestlowcostairlinefor15thconsecutiveyeargsctab0 Its as good or better than most low cost carriers But you get what you pay for,Positive
SkyTrax is a scam and it’s well documented you can essentially buy a SkyTrax award That being said AirAsia is much like Ryanair cheap and reliable with no frills,Neutral
I fly AirAsia a lot It’s a super budget airline you’re just paying for the seat and a carryon bag Everything else checked luggage seat selection meals etc has to be paid The seats are a little small 28 inch legroom if I recall and their customer service is very hard to get to if you have any issues If you don’t need any addons and your flight goes fine then AirAsia is fine,Positive
No they calcelled 3 out of 4 flights and it is a massive pain to get the money back I did not get it back,Negative
used them 4 times last year all of them are okay,Positive
Just came here to say I was a huge supporter of AA previously but kena F by them multiple times until I already seriously got enough of this,Negative
Is it just me or my experience differs from pretty much everyone in this sub My most recent flights actually arrive earlier by like 5 10 mins Granted I never experienced something like that in the video though AA should definitely take action against her,Positive
I’ve flown Ryanair in Europe enough to know that expecting good service from a budget airline is like expecting a rooster to lay eggs,Neutral
If you dont expect much from AA while knowing how common aviation issues happened in general like delays cancellations and such youll have a pleasant experience I had a AirAsia X flight from BKK to KUL but they cancelled 1 month before departure date good shit that they offered a free date change to another day in that same flight but since I wanna go home on the same day I chose the one under Thai AirAsia My preorder meal refunded due to different airline management but not the seat addon Contacted AA and yea waiting sucks 2 weeks later I finally got the needed refunds Not the money refunds mind you bcoz I can use that for purchasing addons on that Thai AA flight Cant deny they have issues Hey every airline does including your favorite ones too If you are just patient enough to be aware deal with these issues everything should be fine,Positive
I was a frequent flier due to my business had 0 problem with them for that 5 years of using their services but that doesnt mean that stuff like this wont happen agrees that airasia should pick up the slack,Neutral
Well i fly at least once a month with AA sometimes up to 4 times a month So far so good Only minor problem when booking with airasia Unlimited but can be sorted out That’s just my experience so far over 10 flight that I flew only one flight delay for 12 hour,Positive
AirAsia being AirAsia after being confronted still wants to threaten customers Professionalism is never in their book,Negative
sorry its not about the company is about the person who racist Do you think AirAsia will train their personnel to be unpolite,Negative
Like Redditor mentioned can’t expect much from budget airlines There’s a reason why AA buys self check in kiosk instead of hiring a human one,Neutral
As stupid as people can get just like your comment it isnt in any way right to call someone stupid in the service business It is not hard to see that the stewardess kantoi this time because the customer understood what she said,Negative
AirAsia sucks No general line to even call Chatting app cannot connect to humans only friggin chatbot called Bo CEO just got extended another 5 years RIP,Negative
They once cancelled my flight without rescheduling or refunding it As you said there’s no way to contact a human at AA The emails available online will leave you unanswered After months of trying my last resort was to go to the airport and simply block one of their counters and demand for their manager representative to get it sorted out At first he obviously told me it’s not his job responsibility but after 2030 minutes they got pretty annoyed at me not stepping away and the manager magically found a number to call From there I got in contact with some actual humans working at Finance and I got a refund within 5 working days Many people I talked to have had similar experiences with cancelled flights and they all just accepted it That’s a near 100 profit for AA and is exactly what they want However if you show them you’re an annoying customer and not worth the hassle they’ll sort it out for you,Negative
I have same exact experience My ticket which they cancelled can’t be refunded whatsoever Not even voucher which I concede after 3 years Like ‘fine you don’t want to give me cash I’ll take points’ It’s been freaking 6 years got cancelled due to COVID and I’m super tired Fuck em Sry for ranting,Negative
What sort of ticket was it I havent had that problem yet with AA What Im currently hate with AA is their time changes,Neutral
Had the same issue as well when I had complaints about their dynamic pricing no possibility of talking to humans Thankfully I had friends working inside AA who had to ask on my behalf Dont even get me started on Bo lol,Negative
They named their app Bo because BO LANG on the other side to actually service you,Negative
Airasia bodoh,Negative
Rm30 to get things settled for their mistake Sounds like they deliberately got the machines not working,Negative
It’s AA Is anybody surprised anymore,Negative
I trust AirAsia the least the most pariah of airlines,Negative
In summary you will suffer from start to end if you plan to travel with AirAsia I was just attempting to purchase a flight 2 days ago on their website but I cannot move ahead with the seat selection Tried on the app and it was the same By now I would have spent almost 1 hour on their website and app I then tried buying from a full service airline and I got my ticket purchased in 10mins This is just the beginning Your holiday plans may be further screwed with their very regular flight reschedules You really suffer from the starting point of your holiday while purchasing tickets all the way to hoping your return flight is not rescheduled,Negative
As long as no issues AirAsia is ok If there is any tiny issues change date lost baggage covid can say bye bye to ur ticket or a few hours of ur life to resolve,Negative
I flew from KLIA2 to Thailand on Friday Had an incident like this happen right in front of me Grumpy AirAsia staff refusing to let people join manual check in queue without evidence the self check in machine was not working I was traveling with wife and two kids For some reason the machine worked fine for their selfcheck in but failed my passport scan several times so I had to go to the standard check in The Air Asia staff was very hostile asked me several times if I had tried to self check in Took a determined explanation from my end had successfully checked in 3 out of 4 passengers at the self check in and was let through but she turned several other people away while I was waiting,Negative
air asia suck ass,Negative
I have a trip coming up with AK and I am already dreading it Why AK Theyre the only ones that fly to my destination,Negative
Many did this There are 2 years case and ended up only got the AirAsia Credit as well,Negative
I understand budget airlines are a compromise on amenities and comforts but nobody should be insulted by uppity staff who dont like doing their jobs This employee should be sacked,Negative
nah bro what tony did was shameless and that is exactly how he wants the rest of his company to act,Negative
Kah3 im a long AAhaters But whenever i insult them I get downvotes by ppl who probably never ever ever deal with AA,Negative
Last time it was the flight attendant who opened the toilet door without cautious now this caseaiyoo so many cases alreadyjust because you’re cheap airline doesn’t mean you can shit on people mahpeople also cannot be treated like humans,Negative
Thats why Japanese Airlines are way better than Rubbish Malaysia AirAsia bodoh,Negative
Have never taken AA and will never take AA,Negative
Boikot AirAsia Done,Negative
The staff and their supervisor who was playing with their phone couldnt be bothered to even relook at the dates when I raised it up responsible staff Air Asia truly has,Negative
Now everyone can get fucked by AA,Negative
Stupid as fuck I dont care bias or what Worker says customer stupid gifgiphyTL66UNOKrO4FJY6vefdownsized,Negative
Boikott Airsia,Negative
Fuck Air Asia seriously,Negative
Air Asia was my worst flight experience ever in my entire life Rude counter staffs rude flight staffs,Negative
Sometime have sometime dont have should be Air Asias motto,Negative
airasia is asias ryanair,Neutral
No matter what you cannot say that word Not professional,Negative
Airasia staff crew have the worst make up in any air line,Negative
Sorry you experienced this but good of you for speaking up I hope AirAsia confronted the staff about this I’m a frequent AA flyer myself and while I’ve came across a few unprofessionals I have never encountered someone as rude as this I would be just as gobsmacked as you if I did,Neutral
Air Asia becoming the Ryan Air of Asia pac,Neutral
This is the exact kind of shit you expect when you book very budget airlines,Negative
I think AirAsia are great if nothing goes wrong and you are an experienced flyer,Positive
as much as i can sympathize with the people who have had bad experiences with AA i myself luckily so far have been alright a few flight cancellations time changes but nothing that i cannot work with hopefully i wont jinx myself,Neutral
The only reason I still using AA because a family member is working there and the perks I get is cheaper ticket and priority flights,Neutral
I hate AA with all my heart but I dont think blaming the airline for its harried staff is going to do anyone any good My family member is still waiting for airport tax refund for a flight they cancelled in 2016 The year that I finally said sayonara to them That being said firefly is late every time The ground staff is indifferent at best landings are anything but smooth but I cant hate them for flying the plebs and facing the idiocy of some of my fellow passengers who should really be taking the bus,Negative
Basically a legal scam company,Negative
Never flying them again Tony still owes me RM500,Negative
Yeah their planes Airbus A320 are pretty safe and reliable Where did you hear about that engine failure before departure Service wise not good The thing people say about delays and the companys reluctance to refund their passengers money is very true I regularly fly with airasia and had some of my flights delayed multiple times,Positive
100 agree AirAsia postCOVID scheduling is a fucking joke If exact travel dates are not that important eg balik kampung where you don’t have to book a hotel and the ticket price is way cheaper then yeah maybe it’s worth the risk Business travel absolutely not,Negative
Better late than never Good chance of flight being delayed especially during peak season However I have so far notbeen into an aircraft that felt outdated or needed repairs So at least safety is still a priority for them,Positive
fucking pariah company reschedule flights according to their whims and fancy and there is no call center for you to call and complaint hope next government makes it a law if your customers cant call and speak to a human being stop doing business in Malaysia,Negative
I swore to never fly with them again They have shady business practices These are things Ive experienced 1 Constant rescheduling of flights This is not uncommon for most airlines However its the way they do it that is terrible For example my flight is at 7pm a bit pricier than a 11am flight They would reschedule my flight to 11am with no reason provided But at the same time the 7pm flight would still be up for sale and if you wish to change it back to 7pm youd have to pay extra 2 Change of the actual plane Theyll change it to a larger plane on occasion The issue is that the perk that Ive paid for eg my hotseat in row 3 was changed to a seat at the back of the plane 3 Terrible just terrible customer service The issues with rescheduling and removal of my hotseat seem easily solvable with customer support However queuing for customer support with their online chat system will take up almost half of your day if not more Incompetent customer service One of the customer service reps keyed in the wrong flight information didnt even confirm my nameflight detail and changed some poor random persons flight and then ended the conversation So Im left in a dead chat box looking at a changed flight thats not even mine Ended up going to the airport just to settle matters with an actual human On another occasion after queuing for hours with their online customer support I didnt even get past giving my flight code before the server timed out I tried using their complaint system bit couldnt due to constant errors Hence I fully hate AirAsia MAS does reschedule flights but their customer support is comparatively more efficient and thorough If you still intend on using AirAsia here are some tips 1 When you eventually need to speak to their online customer support use the ChineseMalay language option Im told the online queue for those are shorter 2 If you cant resolve matters with their online support and you are actually in the right make them go to you Ive tweeted Tony Fernandes and AirAsia about their shitty business practices with screenshots and my official complaint with MAVCOM and all of a sudden AirAsia is DMing me falling over themselves to sort things out and things actually do get sorted out 3 Bookmark FOMCA and MAVCOMs complaint submission page AirAsia deserves all the external inquiries it gets,Negative
Not sure about you guys I flew with them every month back and forth since Feb this year Not even once my flight got delayed Maybe delay happen on certain flight but no problem so far for me It is the same precovid,Positive
BruneiKL KLBrunei SGKL KLSG I fly with them like back and forth at least once a month No problem so far This month I will fly twice brunei to kl and kl to sg,Positive
Theres a 5050 chance that your flight is going to be rescheduled or cancelled Just need to have backup plans,Neutral
AirAsia is the WORST airline Ive ever flown with Their customer service is a joke their airplane is a joke Just do a simple google and you can find that people hardly have anything good to say about AirAsia From my personal experience I had to change my travel dates due to covid but my emails were never replied to and I ended up having to forfeit the amount I paid for the tickets because of this failed company IT IS A SCAM,Negative
Having flown with dozens of airlines from around the world be it budget or full service ones AA is probably the worst in the world in areas of service and backup support You cant even get to speak with a human when you have issues but use AVA CHAT wtf,Negative
Only fly AA when it’s the last plane available to take off from the ground during an apocalyptic earthquake like 2012 and even then they might still delay the flight,Negative
Never flying with them again Basically had my flight rescheduled 5 hours twice when we were already at the gate No amount of savings could convince me otherwise to fly with AA again For those that have yet to experience flight retimed with AA once is enough to convince me that their practices are terrible So my best advise is for you to never experience the same as well and to never fly AA,Negative
Just had this happened to my wife recently Flight was scheduled to depart at 430pm but got delayed to 630pm AA didnt even have the courtesy to inform us only found out about it from Google By then it was too late as she was already on her way to klia2 Reached the gate at 530 but the plane was still nowhere to be seen Finally arrived at 630pm which was the rescheduled departure time The flight eventually departed at 830pm a total of 4 hours delay,Negative
look at AA trying to gauge the publics sentiments BC decently priced seat is decent safety up to standard good choice of foods slight delay but manageable AC if the ground is the lowest benchmark I need to dig 7 ft under it for AA that fckg ava is so useless it gave me high blood pressure dealing with it book them if you have no choice and are not constraint by time,Negative
Ive never had problems flying with them precovid I am not sure if anything has changed back then I only heard about them not yet refunding tickets money during the pandemic not sure if they refunded everyone I dont really fly nowadays because it is expensive,Neutral
“Engine failure before take off” is bullshit The safety record is fine,Positive
Safe Seems okay Reliable Nope I’ve had too many flights changed by them so I’ll pay more to fly Firefly unless AA is my only option,Neutral
The bus mini of airline,Negative
Absolutely dog shit company and dog shit customer experience Like flying in a habitually late petrol station tandas,Negative
Biggest scam,Negative
theyre cheap as safe as any other malaysian airline but have a tendency to reschedule your fight but then youre allowed 1 free flight change so you can reschedule back but subject to seat availability,Neutral
Hey OP I bought a ticket from KL to TWU for Feb 2023 Was rescheduled gifemotefreeemotespacksweatgifemotefreeemotespackdizzyface So yea only fly with them when MAS or any other airline is not an option,Negative
If you need connecting flights avoid AirAsia My recent trip had AirAsia flight rescheduled twice Each time I need to fork out a big chunk of money for alternative flights just to make the connecting flight In the end this budget airline is not really budget and worst with additional added stress to go along with your fares,Negative
The worst part about AA is that they don’t have customer support No phone number no email no inApp chat absolutely nothing They also closed down their counter in Kota Kinabalu permanently They still owe me 700ringgit but there is no way for me to contact them about the case,Negative
Pathetic app as well,Negative
They scammed me several times Prices always bump up when you are about to pay and there is small letter to read how much it becomes credit kept has suddenly be taken away after a flight reservation payment could not be made,Negative
Ive flown Air Asia multiple times and never had an issue What you described could happen to any budget airline to be honest But I do feel for you no one should have to go through that horrible experience in the middle of the night Its like complaining about Ryanair or Jetstar You get what you pay for,Neutral
Exactly the only time Ive suffered delays like this was with United Ryanair have saved me from my own tardiness by picking me out of security queues and Air Asia while they might have no frills at all have always got me where I needed to go,Positive
AirAsia has really good food too,Positive
Its cheap to buy and tastes amazing the flights are dirt cheap too,Positive
Yes full fledge service carrier is neither efficient either but nothing is worse in comparison with Air Asia my dear,Negative
nothing is worse in comparison with Air Asia my dear Jetstar are worse Lufthansa are worse Scoot are much much much much worse I could go on for days listing worse airlines than Air Asia,Positive
Ryanair and Jetstar at least have ways to contact them Air Asia has zero contact whatsoever no phone number or email Just an AI chatbot,Negative
Nah Ryanair is far worse than Air Asia in almost every possible way,Neutral
Well I don’t care so much about their operations when they’ve made me feel like cattle every time I’ve flown with them That’s never happened with Air Asia who are definitely far from perfect,Positive
You are a very lucky person Every time I fly with Airasia min 4 times this year and again tomorrow evening There has been some type of delay Thank goodness for insurance Compared to other Asian budget airlines Scoot VietJet etc theyre by far the worst in terms of customer service delays etc,Neutral
For those who care I’m at Singapore airport for my flight to Bali with Airasia My flight is delayed Albeit by 15 mins Merry Christmas everyone,Negative
I exclusively fly Air Asia all across Asia and have had 00 noteworthy delays in a decade I dunno I think you might just have been extremely unlucky,Positive
This is the complaint 1 Flight canceled not the airlines fault 2 Long lines standard for budget airlines 3 Standard delayed flight compensation offer 4 No hotels available not the airlines fault 5 Minimal customer service standard for budget airlines 6 Difficult reimbursement process standard for budget airlines They had bad luck and a terrible experience but none of the issues were caused by unusually bad service from the airline,Neutral
Are you AirAsia employee Whatever you marked as standard should NOT be standard,Negative
You get what you pay for buddy If you dont want those things pay for a better airline Theres a reason why the tickets are cheap You probably think that your 5 Bluetooth earphones should be just like airpods too lol,Positive
Hello Air Asia is neither cheap not efficient my dear Perhaps u did not fly frequently with Air Asia and you are fortunate that your flight did not delay during that time,Negative
What you described could happen to any budget airline,Neutral
Yeah honestly the inherent nature of air travel is that theres always a risk itll devolve into a total shit show If you go looking for them you can find horror stories about pretty much every carrier on the planet Im not saying all carriers are equal of course but theres always at least some risk that youll have a nightmare experience,Neutral
The CEO so damn disgusting why people still bother to travel with them Save some money and your mental health just go with any reputable full service airlines They will take care of these things when flight cancellation Basically low cost airline is great when everything went smoothly but once you encounter these issue you are pretty much on your own,Negative
When the price difference is hundreds of dollars Im willing to take the risk That can be an extra few days worth of travel expenses for somewhere in Asia,Negative
Weird I had the complete opposite experience with AirAsia in Thailand Flight got delayed and we missed our connection they met us at the gate after we left the plane then arranged transport to a hotel for the night and a taxi back to the airport the following morning I was genuinely impressed but I guess the standards must vary wildly between different AirAsia countries,Positive
Good to know because Im flying Air Asia in Thailand,Neutral
Thailand has some of the best customer service out there,Positive
NEVER fly Air Asia to Australia and never fly via a hub Its only to be used between two short haul Asian cities one of which being KL But order the Nasi Lemak,Negative
Once I flew back from Maldives to KL on AA we were dead tired but ordered 2 extra Nasi Lemak Pak Nasser just to eat at home after a nap lol,Neutral
5 stars for the Nasi Lemak,Positive
Also The vegetable briyani is 1010 for me,Positive
You get what you pay for That being said their customer service is dogshit and I hate that chatbot Bo with a passion Fuck you Bo,Negative
Bo is so fucking useless fr,Negative
I just tricked Bo into changing my flights for free I love Bo now But fuck Bo every other time,Negative
I will destroy BOs servers if given the opportunity,Negative
for budget airlines maybe its best to buy insurance that covers flight delays some credit cards give complimentary insurance too never had issue with AA tbh,Positive
Never had any issues with Air Asia thailand Air Asia Indonesia however has a much worse reputation Overall Air Asia Thailand is quite reliable,Positive
Its own CEO prefer to fly SQ,Neutral
Is that really weird though I dont think CEOs generally fly on budget carriers Even if he flew on AirAsia we would think it was just a photo opp,Neutral
Recently booked a short flight to Malaysia When I got to the payment page they declined my payment I‘ve checked and am 100 sure the card details were right The page requested me to refresh and I found out the price of the flight increased I booked the flight at the higher price with THE SAME CARD,Negative
I hate Air Asia They are the WORST,Negative
I had the air Asia pass and flew with them 12 times this year Almost every flight was delayed That insurance would be worth it,Negative
I’ve also had major issues with Air Asia They left me stranded in KL when my midnight flight to Tokyo got ‘retimed’ from midnight to 6am The 20 food vouchers I battled the service desk for were not much use at 1am when every food joint had long since closed These Charlatans will never get a dollar of mine again,Negative
My biggest gripe with AirAsia is that they charge you for paying smh Recently booked a flight for £400 and I had to pay an extra £20 transaction fee which is only visible at the final step of booking Sneaky way of drawing you in when comparing flight prices,Negative
Sounds horrible but I rate Air Asia over Qantas and Jetstar who I have had many horrible experiences with I guess any airline can be shitty but I’ve found AA to be on time good service and pretty bloody good food only eaten the Indo food but it’s always as tasty as and a heap cheaper that Shitstars shitty sandwiches,Positive
They are the worst,Negative
Just flew air Asia for the first time Had a flight change and was stuck there for 6 hours at KL airport Probably won’t use their services again I wasn’t too thrilled about them,Negative
Air Asia is shit has always been shit and will continue to be so,Negative
Us Malaysian knows this and wholeheartedly piss off with Tony MAS all the way,Negative

Yep they owe me 1500 from cancelled flights during ye olde covid tymes and have given me an unusable voucher,Negative
I had almost forgotten about the refund for my COVIDcancelled flight that I had been waiting about 2 years for But to my surprise it did get refunded to my credit card a couple of months back,Positive
The queue was insane last time I went air asia It was 1 hour line for check in There were about 10 people working the check in It wasn’t horrible,Positive
Flew with Air Asia a couple of times and no issues at all On one occasion the flight time changed but we easily managed to book a different flight online for free Sucks that happened to you Those issues can happen with most airlines Very few airlines handle those issues well,Positive
This is absolutely ridiculous The airline should have a better process Simple as Paying customers expect and deserve more You’re probably useless yourself,Negative
You chose a cheap option for long hail and did no research Tough You learned a lesson Air Asia is a budget airline for cheapskates Whining afterwards wont help with that vile cheat Indian CEO,Neutral
Thats what makes them budget You can choose to add those things Its the same as most budgets if you add all the inclusions their price gets up there,Neutral
Air Asia flight AK527 SGN KUL Right now 3 hours delay Still waiting,Negative
Air Asia is well known for their shitty and absurd way of doing business They nearly gone bankrupt during pandemic times and yet have not learn their lessons Will only take air asia when in worst scenario like no more flights available on that day and urgent to fly off,Negative
I concur after my experience today They handed over a BOARDING PASS with a gate number when I was checking in luggage Now when it was boarding time I wait 510mins at nobody turned up so I checked Google and find the gate was different from the one printed on my boarding pass handed over to me by Air Asia staff The new gate was on the other side of the airport and I had my pregnant wife who couldnt move very fast and we missed the flight So I spent the next few hours running to collect my checked baggage and then exited and then rentered the airport and waited outside while my pregnant wife was stuck inside,Negative
AIR ASIA IS DEFINITELY GARBAGEA BUNCH OF COMUNISTS FORMING A SO FALL AIRLINE AS I AM WROTING THIS COMMENT I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALREADY FOR 45 MINUTES FOR THE SITE TO DISPLAY THE FLIGHTS NOTHING DISPLAYS YETTOTAL GARBAGE TOTAL TRASH A BUNCH OF COMUNISTS RETARDS WHO SCAMED MANY TO FORM A GARBAGE AND A FAILURE THEY CALL AIRLINES,Negative
PSI was so frustrated I have misspelled many words trying to book a flight for over an hour and 23 minutesWHAT A GARBAGE AIRLINE,Negative
AirAsia is fine if there is utterly no issue and you fly from a to b and thats that When anything comes up My goodness they are useless Unless you are in Malaysia or other ASEAN countries where they have AirAsia sales offices,Negative
Crap u pay for the shittest airline and whinge cos it’s shit,Negative
Just checked into Air Asia like 20 minutes ago Im aware its a budget airline so Im not really pressed nor care about the service onboard but their web experience is genuinely the worst Ive ever seen of any airline Theres no excuse for any airline to have such a buggy websiteapp that literally softblocks you from your flight with absolutely 0 way of doing anything about it online except for physically asking an airline employee at the airport Every other airline even budget airlines like Spirit Frontier Ryanair Jetstar etc have actual functioning websites that let you do the bare minimum of being able to actually checkinmodify your itinerary on the site Also Fuck Bo Bo a bitch 25 to anyone that jailbreaks Bo and makes him recite Top 10 South African Insect Populations,Negative
I need to warn everyone about the absolute disaster I’ve been through with AirAsia Heres what happened I booked a flight from Puerto Princesa to Manila which was rescheduled last minute to a later time This ruined my plans since I needed to arrive in Manila as per the original schedule I tried their free reschedule option through their AI customer service Bo but they claimed all earlier flights were full Guess what I ended up buying another AirAsia ticket for an earlier flight which was magically available after they told me otherwise spending a lot of extra money I requested a refund for the original ticket and reimbursement for the additional expense but they denied it As if that wasn’t bad enough I also bought their travel insurance specifically for situations like this flight insurance in case of flight delay The flight was clearly delayed but they STILL rejected my insurance claim AirAsias incompetence and refusal to take responsibility have cost me both time and money not to mention the stress of dealing with their awful customer service Their promises of convenience and support are nothing but lies If youre thinking of flying AirAsia think twice—especially if youre counting on them to honor their insurance or refund policies This airline has been nothing but a source of frustration and disappointment Learn from my mistake Fly with a more reliable airline even if it costs a bit more—it will save you a lot of grief,Negative
I flew with them twice and got one delay,Negative
They are a low cost airline Why did you book Air Asia if you wanted Singapore Airlines servicetreatment,Neutral
And it flies pretty often and isnt posted about People arent posting their nothing went wrong stories as prolifically as people post their negative stories,Neutral
This is why I never fly budgeted airlines I would rather pay much expensive reliable airline and cut my hotel budget,Negative
The distinction between budget and full service is no longer too clear they can all make mistakes lose luggage have shit service Actually the oldest most near end of life planes I’ve been on have all been full service airlines,Neutral
Air Asia is horrible Just avoid The on board service is fine when things work out but everything else like online booking hidden fees scheduling customer service hotlines claims etc is pretty much the worst Even suspect they’re not good at keeping credit card info secure Never again,Negative
I just watched Netflix on Malaysia A370 seems like Air Asia provided exceptional service,Positive
Aaand this why I only take national carriers for international flights,Negative
Lol like No duh What were you expecting People are really out here paying for bare bones budget airlines and expecting full service,Neutral
This is the company who refused to refund flight costs for cancellations during COVID when everyone was worried about their finances I wont forgive or forget,Negative
There should be a rule youre not allowed to judge an airline until youve taken it at least 3 times Air Asia has always been positive for me so you must have gotten unlucky,Positive
For long haul flights try to skip budget airlines if you want to prioritise a bit of a better service,Neutral
Their 333 on a330 is an ass and I refuse to use their medium haul route,Negative
Ive flown Air Asia dozens and dozens of times within Thailand and never encountered a single issue But at Kuala Lumpurs International Terminal Oh heck yeah Air Asia is horrible Have had delay problems almost every step of the way I took my gf with me to KL a few months back and told her we had to arrive at KL airport several hours before our departure flight otherwise the routine delays would mean we could miss our flight Just dropping off baggage is messed up there,Negative
I think I was in this very same flight at Sydney airport Airasia rep was dogshit and just told us there weren’t any hotel rooms Had to sleep on the hard chairs and security kept pissing us off saying we can’t sleep there I paid for another flight out as I can’t afford to miss my connection in Kuala Lumpur Was told I can submit a claim for refund which I did but the stupid app just closed my case a few days back with no refund in sight Chatted with Bo almost everyday and same shit response case is closed please leave your feedback bs I’m a thousand bucks out of pocket as I bought addons for my luggage and gear A mate who works in the industry told me Air Asia is not a member of IATA that’s why they are able conduct such dodgy business practices and get away with it Never again Just avoid this cck suckers Save up and fly with a proper airline,Negative
Air Asia is shit,Negative
The fact that i am writing this 5 months later after your complaint about almost similar experience with airasia website just proved that our complaints fell on deaf ears almost exactly similar i was trying to pick a seat for my family of five and was going through the check out process and suddenly i realize that i need to add my luggage amount so i go back and try to edit my purchase then the addons page stuck i tried again and it got stuck again i have tried different browser cleared the cookies and cache trying the same thing using mobile app nothing works and then this Bo really get me exploded he was so confused with every input i gave him he even asked me to get in touch with somebody where he provided a link to that somebody and guess what it is himself i click the link and it opens a chat room with Bo on the other end of the line i thought AI supposed to help our lifeit seems it has ruin my life,Negative
Seems about on par with Asian cheap carriers Cebu Pacific website is a cluster fuck,Negative
For some reason many airlines in SEA have third class internet sites Both Air Asia and Cebu Pacific have crappy web sites but AA at least has an app thats usually a bit better I gave up on CPs app and web,Negative
Air asia hasnt been working properly for me either,Negative
Came here because both the airasia website and mobile app are simply not working and took your advice on tripcom Wow Infinitely better experience Smooth well thought out just works Cheers,Negative
Same boat as you Doesnt work been about 30 hours,Negative
Yup Im in the exact same situation as you the site just breaks at the payment screen Really dont want to book with AirAsia but they are the cheapest in SEA for a lot of routes,Neutral
Major 1 Got stuck on OTP then when I finally got past that I couldn’t pay,Negative
As another commenter said you can enter any numbers into the OTP to get passed it Once I did this i was able to complete a booking Maybe it’s broken further since then though this was a few weeks ago,Negative
It didnt work for me Im trying all sorts of numbers Did you use a US number,Negative
Ah maybe they stopped the OTP verification accepting any verification code I used an NZ phone number and never received any OTP code after trying many many many times Once the other commenter told me I could use any number for the verification I just tried 123456 and it let me in Pretty pathetic experience from Air Asia tbh,Negative
I’m having issues too I’m completely locked out of my account it’s hard to get a representative thru Bo Takes a couple of tries,Negative
Air Asia sucks and kinda a fraud,Negative
AirAsia website is an absolute trash comapred to other flight providers,Negative
This new AirAsia Move sucks You can’t open any of your itinerary flights as pop up message indicates that you’re browser is not compatible for this website I have tried using Google Safari etc to zero availability Then I tried going through the actual airline carrier website that I’m flying with BINGO I’m in can see all my flights AirAsia is not for me after this is all over,Negative
I can’t even book the flight Driving me mad Tried 5 times from pc and phone and no luck,Negative
Hey I was having the same issue with AirAsia Ive been trying to purchase extra baggage but their website encounters problems every time the bot asks me to click on the link Ive been trying for about five days Then today I tried filing a complaint through the bot and it finally routed me to a live agent,Negative
bruh we in this together innit fuck bo btw the most obnoxious pseudo helpful bot of all time airasia is a fucking fraud,Negative
Agreed but im sweating because i want to do addons for my 55h flight to japan and add a day Guess i have to do it in my travel day,Neutral
I went to airasia Japan first class lounge 1 day ago It taste like somebody eat there winky,Neutral
Welcome to Oct 2024 and SURPRISE there has been no improvements AT ALL Tried for 5h to buy a ticket from country A to country B and the goddamned website stalls at every page the phone app refuses to acknowledge my phone number phone number is not allowed for sms So I gave up on them and within 30min of signing up and checking out the Tway website I actually got to book my flights They are even having a promotion now apart from the new signup discount Paid way less than what was displayed in the Air Asia website So disappointing and waste of time istg,Negative
It’s like their goals is to Make the experience as fucking impossible as possible I can’t use the app because it gives me an OTP but then I can’t enter it as keyboard doesn’t show up on iPhone The air Asia move app looks shit and feels like it’s not the airlines app but some random 3rd party crap layered over the top,Negative
Airasia has not enabled me to correct my gender at all and even to update my name in the personal information page Both website and phone app are so horrendous i wonder how the hell are they remaining afloat when it is almost impossible to book any flights let alone get verified in their shitty system,Negative
Me too very frustrated with AirAsia chat agent for a week Everyday chat with them regarding my ticket booked through airasia website but the airline is belong to Cebu Pacific Hence they ask me to check with Cebu pacific I approached Cebu pacific chat also comes to no avail I had made a payment to make amendment to the ticket throught the chat but here is my actual trouble They said my email does not match hence cannot receive the updated itinerary ticket In fact I received the confirmation email when book through the airasia website Proof that my email was correct when I book the ticket through airasia website My lesson is that dont ever book any other airline through airasia website once you have trouble they will ask you approach the airline you had booked They wont take responsibility of any trouble you gone through although you book through airasia website,Negative
their website is a pile of shit and always will be,Negative
Their site is really bad The whole experience of purchasing travel is disappointing,Negative
Same issues Canadian cc used turns out my bank was blocking it for security reasons the entire timehowever I also never received an OTP also blocked for 24hrs now,Negative
Yeah its shit Goddamn impossible to make a flight booking Half the time they session timeoutrate has changed other times the book button just stays on hover and never proceeds,Negative
Already for some weeks can’t complete anything at Airasia app it always stop working at the middle of the task,Negative
There is a problem with their OTP system I enter my phone number correctly in the app but on the next page where its going to send the OTP it has removed the second digit of my phone number Its a greyed out field that you cannot edit They are completely ridiculous,Negative
Airasia has gone from bad to worse Tried to change a flight the system either didnt recognize my booking failed to load on any of the pages on the way to the final payment page or wouldnt accept ANY type of payment be it credit card or online banking,Negative
Having very bad experience with their sitewanted to upgrade baggage their oldie bot is not working,Negative
I guess you didn’t know the shits they did during Covid times,Negative
They still owe us 700,Negative
People had to beg for refunds for one,Negative
Most dont even get any refund,Negative
I dont get my refund lost around 450 fuck Air Asia,Negative
Oh they gave me my rm300 in credit but it was during the no flights period and expired before most people can travel,Negative
Lost 27k yes they did give refund voucher acc is jammed because of their stupid otp issue that they absolutely refuse to solve Customer service is useless I consider it gone,Negative
Spent RM900 on a cancelled flight due to covid it turned into a voucher expiring in a couple of years which I could never redeem lol,Negative
And after they got into debt restructuring they are legally excused from refunding the customers,Negative
They selling ghost flight tickets aka flight that they knew not going to happen eg flight to China even after China announce border lockdown claiming they are getting approval from China gov In fact China do have a whitelist of flights into country but Airasia was not in the list for most of the three years lockdown and they are selling tickets during the whole 3 years If you happened to buy the ghost flight they will refund as Airasia points only which mean they get to keep all your money and the points only valid for certain periods Worst of all some places only have one flight per month so if you bought the ghost flight the earliest next flight with valid airlines and flights will be next month,Negative
Exactly Lost my money stolen by AA,Negative
I personally rather pay more for other flights than taking AA,Negative
True been using MAS constantly for years now for my frequent flying between Sabah and KL The event that made me boycott AA is years back when someone showed their cheap ticket was being cancelled and yet that flight still keeps selling on much higher price AA almost always rescheduledelayoversell their seat until a point that I rather pay more to have peace of mind Not that MAS is perfect at least the rate of delayreschedule is damn low compare to AA,Negative
After buying air asia all this years and after the last AA I booked and ride I concluded that I rather pay MAS and save my TIME that i cant buy from wasting 8h cause the plane got delayed until night I gave up truly on AA,Negative
Well if I want to travel long haul I will pick JAL or other airlines for a comfortable experience but shot haul Ill go for AA cuz is cheap lol,Positive
I never took ANA before but might try soon,Neutral
The delay is just one small aspect Its the crummy way they run the business These are all my personal experiences that have led me to avoid using AA The first issue was when they rescheduled the cheap flight time that I had reserved months in advance to a much much later time at least ten hours apart If the flight itself was cancelled then thats fine but the fact was they were selling the exact same flight slot and I later learned from ground staff that it was the exact same plane for a significantly higher price point because a holiday was declared and that flight date suddenly became a hot commodity The second issue was when they changed the plane and with it all my upgradesextras seatfood suddenly disappeared but I was still charged the same amount The third issue was with their CS No hotline to call Just an unhelpful AI that made it very difficult to get through to an actual human And when I was eventually patched to a human the system would disconnect during the conversation The whole conversation would be dropped despite having conveyed the entirety of the issue my email address flight info etc and the CS having promised to make the necessary arrangementsrefundetc With zero follow up Its as though the conversation never happened As though the complaint ticket was never issued I resorted to a few angry tweets at Tony Fernandes AAs CEO before AA slid into my DMs to rectify the issues My last issue is a personal one I used to frequently fly between states and there is one particular steward that is on that route If that steward is here on Reddit and is reading this please please stop singing on the flight Your voice is not good and no one paid to be imprisoned for 25 hours to hear you sing continuously Ever notice that no one claps when youre done Well please notice it Im not a religious person but I pray every day for you to find the strength to combat your delusions and narcissism,Negative
i have to agree flown scoot many times generally no complaints Theyve been late a few times which is annoying but at this point im resigned to it being inevitable for any LCC but they dont have any of the rescheduling or ghost flight nonnsense that AA does I much prefer Scoot to AA or even Batik Air which isnt a LCC but is as unpunctual as one I have missed important business meetings because of AAs reschedule nonsense If i book a flight ticket i need the peace of mind to know i will get there roughly on time Not whenever AA decides to take me there,Negative
U gonna compare low cost budget airlines to premium ones If you cant afford it quit complaining you’re getting what you paid for There are people out there who can’t even afford to travel overseas so IDK why do people complain so much,Positive
Im flying from Kl to tokyo in Nov and even ANA is cheaper than AA AA is not cheap its not even budget anymore,Negative
If youre comparing regular full fares then its no way ANA will be cheaper than AA Stop comparing discounted fares with regular fares,Neutral
AA is a fkn stain on Malaysia as a brand Their refund policy is shit their CS is shit their counter staff is shit planes always late They really set the benchmark for how not to run a budget airline,Negative
I had one refund rejected because of Russian sanctions The flight was booked with a Hong Kong credit card My other refunded flight gave credits that expired BEFORE flights continued Absolute clowns I fucking hate their policies and I absolutely despise the garbage chatbot,Negative
Yeah that POS Bo,Negative
Bo is acronym of Bodoh,Neutral
What cs You mean the bot that they have That garbage bot Can’t even get connected to cs,Negative
Experienced this In my last trip to Japan I purchased 3 flexi premium beds During check in they said nope they miscalculated and there are no more premium beds you’re gonna move down to normal seats The counter said I have to talk to Bo online bot to get compensation After the flight talked to Bo requested compensation and got back a dismal RM30 3 premium beds to Japan cost about RM3k I kept insisting for more compensation and end up getting back RM2k That took 2 weeks of stressful conversations with CS,Negative
Wait AA got cs What is their contact number I was trying to get in touch with cs and couldnt find any info how to talk with them,Negative
There is CS They purposely bury it deep into Bo algorithm it’s so hard to get CS I forgot the steps but you can get real person CS from Bo,Negative
AirAsia doesn’t give two fucks for their customers Based on how they treat their customers in terms of refunds support and cancellations I’d almost go so far as to say that they hate their customers I would rather pay more on a full fare airline than give money to a company that treats their customers like shit because they have the price advantage I feel for anyone that doesn’t have that option because AirAsia fucking sucks,Negative
sometimes they dont even have the price advantage shop around more because there are so many budget airlines and full fare airlines are always giving discounts too,Neutral
Lost rm2000 but they only give stupid credit that expired 2 years and 2019 but expired in 2021 due to lock down cant use the credit till this day hate air asia and also hate klia terminal 2 too long prefer malaysia airline because they at klia terminal 1,Negative
I fly AA pretty frequently Honestly delays are probably a 1 out of 20 incident for me I think their service is not bad considering its so cheap Their staff is also quite friendly Longest delay when I was flying from Indonesia to KL which was delayed for 4 hours They refunded me part of the fare and paid for my food The only thing I hated was their customer service bot Kinda annoying that I need to go through hoops to talk to a legit person,Positive
amongst the worst experience I had recently with AA was a flight to Singapore that I booked for 10am got rescheduled to freaking 4am and the sms was sent after midnight Luckily i hadnt fallen asleep yet and saw the message Tried to reach CS which is non existant and the chatbot is intentionally designed to be useless and unhelpful in these matters So i had to rush and pack and drive myself to the airport at 2am as i couldnt get a grab that early in the morning and then wasted so much money on KLIA2 parking And then my friend kena worse Booked a weekend getaway to langkawi but then the Saturday departure flight was rescheduled from early morning to late afternoon And then worse after she landed in Langkawi that evening she got an SMS that her return flight was rescheduled from Sunday evening to 11am So in the end she flew to Langkawi checked into the hotel and slept Woke up and had breakfast and checked out and went straight to the airport WTF kind of weekend getaway All thanks to AirAsia,Negative
I call BS on this how exactly am i supposed to change my flight timing at 1am with the actual fligth no scheduled to leave 3 hrs away though their piece of shit useless chatbot that is intentionally designed to frustrate and not answer customer requests by talking useless shit in circles At the time Anthony Loke hadnt forced air asia to reintroduce human customer service so there was litterally no option other than their POS chatbot the one before BO cant remember what its called Whatever bullshit airasia writes on their FAQ or propaganda pieces doesnt match up to reality,Negative
Which routes do you normally fly Their ontime performance is horrible for certain routes it’s quite ridiculous Some of the scheduled routes can be 65 on time Their service once the plane takes off is fine it’s the service on ground that’s horrible,Negative
I frequently fly between KLJB Indonesia Jakarta Surabaya and Singapore recently My flights to and fro JB pretty much always on time even with early arrival most of the time,Positive
Same here it feels like I live in a different world compared to others I frequently and exclusively fly AirAsia and the worst delay Ive had was almost a full day in Haneda and they gave everyone hotel and food vouchers for it all in all came out to be positive My worst experience was accidentally leaving my laptop in the plane and I got it back the next day My most flown routes are KULCGK KULSIN KULDMK and KULPEN for reference,Positive
Customer service bot is litilery fuck but their Nasi lemak is not bad,Neutral
Food is actually not bad and not overpriced I could eat cheaper on the plane than at my office location LOL I dont eat much on the plane though since I always eat at the airport lounge before boarding,Positive
They refuse to return my money for a trip overseas due to covid I will forever hate them and will always yearn for the day that AA goes under,Negative
Yup Refund rejected because of Russian sanctions It was a Hong Kong credit card I also look forward to their bankruptcy Fuck AA and fuck Tony Fernandez,Negative
Oh man where do I begin Short summary unethical business practices noncustomer centricity appalling company culture tone deaf ceo Yes customer service and flight operations are bad everyone says that its part of a budget airline etc so I wont repeat these again Let me highlight things some may or may not know unethical biz practices embezzlement of funds CEO Tony company took customer monies and siphoned it into other pet projects then during covid refused to refund customers and declared bankruptcy to escape paying all creditors What are these stupid pet projects The Santan restaurant which no one goes to and their digital superapp Go Google articles during their bankruptcy phase Tony said that their doubling down on the superapp Where do the funds come from Ridiculous appalling company culture known to be full of misogynist men who try to sleep with everyone I worked at a consulting firm that did work for them about 78 years ago The girls on the team asked to be removed from the engagement as it was extremely uncomfortable The MeToo movement never happened in Malaysia so unfortunately this culture is rampant all the way to the top I cant say if this has changed but really culture comes from the top Disclaimerthese are my colleagues telling me what happened I didnt see it myself sellout CEO how could anyone forget that Tony showed that he is a sellout publishing that video supporting a political party before the 2018 elections and once PH won he said Im sorry I was forced to No integrity Also tone deaf Remember him posting about his new Tesla during covid These alone should be enough to piss you off I wont mention all the other small things everyone is aware of This alone makes me happy to pay for any other airline even Mas despite how bad they are as well,Negative
Dont forget about his photo of receiving shoulder massage while half naked n doing some work on the laptop,Negative
Not a Malaysian but a Singaporean I have taken AirAsia to KL Ipoh Bangkok on numerous occasions Their service is alright I dont expect much when I am flying budget airlines So far I have never encountered any cancelled flights and only once my flight from Ipoh to SG was delayed for 30 mins I would say that they are reliable compared to other budget airlines,Positive
When it goes as planned I’d agree with you and say that yeah you get what you pay for Can’t be expecting caviar and champagne Everyone has an AirAsia horror story Here’s my favorite Person booked a flight through AirAsia with a layover in KL This was a single booking AA changed the time one of their flights moving it FORWARD in time by two hours and notifying them by SMS an hour before the new flight time That would be bad enough but it was only the beginning The only way to contact support was talking to an inbred chatbot They tried to cancel the retimed leg so they could rebook to a flight they could actually catch The chatbot canceled the other leg Later on it wouldn’t refund them because they were a “no show” so didn’t qualify for a refund,Negative
Scoot is so much better these days though it feels like what AA used to be They compete with them on price but offer better value and service imo Im happy going the extra way to SG first for a connection if need be its basically the same price anyway for long trips to aussie compared to starting from KL,Negative
Exactly its a budget airlines Its like a bus that flys Keep your expectations low and if you messed up you not gonna get you money back If you want 5 star treatment fly full service,Neutral
nah that a bad attitude you pay for something you should get the service its nonsense that people have come to expect to be screwed over by budget airlines as something normal and acceptable,Negative
how do you find AA compared to Scoot Personally I fly between KL and SG a lot and have come to settle on Scoot as my preferred airline unless the price is too high compared to others,Neutral
I do take Scoot as well Phuket Bangkok Macau KL I think both budget airlines are quite good Perhaps I have been lucky never experienced my flights cancelled or rescheduled There are quite a number of negative feedback on Scoot too I personally feed that the onboard crew service of Scoot is slightly better than AirAsia End of the day I am paying for a budget flight so my expectations of them cannot be as high as those full board airlines like SQ MAS Vietnam Airline Thai airways etc,Positive
yup really the ONLY thing I expect from a budget airline is to give me the service I paid for and get me to my destination on time safely but sadly that seems like too much of an ask,Negative
If I want to compare to budget airlines from Europe or America I think I would just stay with AA,Positive
I was one of their 737 before and trust me their seat is way worst then AA,Neutral
I cant imagine what would happen,Neutral
Thats Germanwings,Neutral
short haul is fine long haul just be careful they cancel your flight,Neutral
Like any other budget airlines it is only cheap when you fly barebones red eye no luggage no food etc It is genuinely much much 50 cheaper than then next competitor The complains arise when after adding up all the addons the price is comparable but still cheaper to national carriers but the service and comfort of a budget airline Compared to ryanair easyjet even scoot and virgin airways Airasia is as close as functioning as a nonbudget airline level They try their best to be professional have good food and inflight entertainment even for local flights The other budget airlines really treat you like taking a bus Ive taken a budget airline in PH and the old aunties carry market produce on the flight and the airline dont really care Ive seen Ryanair stewardess carry a weighing machine at the boarding gate queue to weigh luggages so they can charge to check in Do AA deserve the hate Yes and no They really do try to nickel and dime everything to maximise profit at the expense of customers comfort But they are the still the best budget airline in the world for x years for a reason The other budget airlines really do suck,Positive
They fkd over many customers during covid No refunds when flights were cancelled or rescheduled to a later date Batik air is the next affordable choice and their seats are way more comfortable than AA When the seats are up they are still slightly inclined and have much more leg space,Negative
I dont really have an opinion on this issue but Id like to say that I hope everyone is hating on the company itself and not all the staff althought some of them are rude tbf since my brother and sister is a cabin crew for AA Theyre only there for the pay but the random shit people give them for their hatred on the company is stupid and underseving Please everyone direct ur hatred to the personway,Neutral
Ryanair charges you half the rates of that in air asia same with spirit Goodluck tryna make a refund if anything happens,Negative
They flatout refused to give refunds to their customers back during covid I still have RM800 in credits Only valid for international flights 4 hours and above lmao Stupid company,Negative
Air asia never refund me They use so many loopholes and shadiness F them i will never use them ever again,Negative
The COVID thing happened where people had to beg for a refund which was bad enough but I hate how every flight Ive ever had with them has been delayed They used to be good at the start but honestly their flight ticket prices compared to budget airlines are about the same now Scoot is honestly way better in terms of punctuality and hospitality and its often cheaper as well sometimes,Negative
Used air Asia exclusively when I had done trading back then Used them for at least 3 years non stop one trip every month 0 problem But i wouldnt discount how other people had problem with them I had none That includes casual trip Ive made privately Their price fits the service that they have given to me,Positive
people who shit on air asia never lived in times where a flight anywhere will cost a bomb aa allowed so many people to fly around relatively cheaply heck some of us can have return flight to japan or korea for below 1k the above is true and its not a defense against aa poor customer service timeliness or condition of flights,Positive
I’ve managed to travel around on a budget without taking AA so it’s still possible to fly sans dealing with the shit they do,Negative
They didnt notify us that our flight departure back to Malaysia was moved up a day Not delayed but moved up No email no SMS no call,Negative
I had to go through a third party service to get a refund It took close to 6 months,Negative
You have options We dont We fly AirAsia because we have to not because we want to,Neutral
I pity you MAS has scrapped intraBorneo routes like KuchingSibu KuchingBintulu KKSandakan and KKTawau leaving passengers to just use Airasia for air travel effectively a monopoly,Negative
I bought a ticket to fly back to Malaysia for around RM300 The night before my flight at 11PM they sent me an email saying my booking was cancelled with no explanation I checked and the same flight was available for purchase and I did end up getting on that flight too Except this time it was RM1500 instead 5 freaking times more Thats €300 for you and here you are complaining about losing out on CA20 and £40 on the other airlines Still no refund so fk AirAsia and your lame reasoning why its better than the rest because in reality it operates exactly the same way,Negative
I only have 2 rules when I use AA 1 only essential flight or if long haul add a baggage and nothing else No add on nothing 2 no other airlines Miri to BKK but this is slowly changing I’m tryna getting use to mas wing,Neutral
Too risky for me Delay is more frequent what I heard from my colleague who fly kuching to Miri,Negative
I never had issue with AA tbh maybe reschedule for few hrs but i was okay with that and im pretty lucky But i boycotted AA bcos of their other service i have been chased like shit for their system and CS incompetencies Why should i transfer money when they can just deduct money from my ewallet that i reload The money is already there Nevertheless it was a bad experience from being chased by them and they change their tnc after my case,Negative
AirAsia has an abysmal customer service,Negative
Air Asia is always late they regularly move gates at the last minute to one on the opposite side of the airport they have abysmal leg room and seem to take great delight in destroying my luggage Are there worse airlines Sure Air Nigeria in the 1970s was worse but not much But in SE Asia Air Asia is the pits I love going to Malaysia but I wish Air Asia wasnt the main airline for me on the routes I take,Negative
Yeah airasia is bad but they are still a viable option despite their shittiness due to their price and availability They dont need to be good in service They probably wont be your preferred choice but most of the time it would still be a good choice all things considered You will gamble a chance of getting fucked over to save abit of money It does make me feel poor when I am not willing to pay a couple thousands more just to settle for shitty air asia,Neutral
10 years travelling with them and not a single delay or issue plus I got the two refunds on COVID time I honestly cant complain at all about them Of course shit happens and I believe peoples complaints but at the same time I know personally many people that has FOMO and just repeat what others say without reasons which happens a LOT in Malaysia in general,Positive
Indo here had no problems with AA yet Mind you I took the MY AA not the ID AA Flight was from CGKKUL CEO was on the plane though so it helped a lot LMAO Return flight was fine also ID staffs were nice as commonly seen in ID airlines,Positive
I suspect most people hate AA due to their behaviour during the pandemic where they did not pay out for cancelled flights If this had happened in Europe you would have being entitled to compensation We had around €500 of flights and ended up getting money back by going through the Malaysia aviation commission to get it back Would never fly with them again,Negative
Im a frequent AirAsia flyer People dont get how they keep things low cost Its like getting an Axia rahmah and complaining about how little you get for such a cheap price They dont give you food extra leg space or check in baggage just to keep costs low No other flight offers prices as low as theirs RM29 from KL to Langkawi RM19 from Kuching to KK RM160 to Bali If you want addons and you can afford it or fly other airlines good for you But for a budget traveler who wants to fly good for them Their taxi time is about 20 minutes meaning people get off once they land new passengers get on board and they go to their next destination They save costs because pilots cabin crew dont have to stay at the destination Because of the tight schedule if anything goes wrong its a domino effect for all their other flights It can range from a malfunction weather crews getting sick or exceeding legal work hours due to delays airport technical issues these will all affect the flights And its not even limited to AirAsia All airlines can be affected They often reschedule or cancel flights but they give you the option of changing your flights 30 days before or after your initial date or refund your credits I utilize this feature for holidays Id book on a week close to public holidays and prepare myself for that week If theres a flight change and I am given a free reschedule Ill move my flights to the dates of the public holiday FOR FREE If you try to book flights on the same day it will usually be 34x more expensive I get to save my AL in this case If you still want to travel on your initial dates just choose a different time on the same day And all these are easy to do via the chat bot There are 2 scenarios Ive faced that benefited me I booked return flights to Kuching for a holiday for RM160 They moved my flight 6 months before the actual date I waited During a sale they were selling Krabi return tickets for RM190 I refunded my RM160 and added RM30 for a flight to Krabi instead I booked the flights for a weekend in the end of March Few months before that flight they moved the time I then changed my dates to the songkran festival an experience I always wanted to try It was always more expensive to fly on Songkran dates but with my free flight change I managed to go for a really low price If you have a complicated case and need an actual customer service just spam the chatbox saying stuff like your problem isnt solved I need an agent It usually gets me connected to one after a few spams For those affected during COVID19 I managed to get RM800 credits for future flights They gave 3 years validity for it I bought flights for other people and they transferred the money to me It was never limited to just your own name The balance credits I use to fly Theres just so much online hate on AirAsia They have an ontime performance rate of more than 80 People only bitch about AirAsia whenever their flight is delayed You dont see them post compliments when the flights arrive on time,Positive
Recently AA has been kinda shit since klia2 and has been actual shit post covid Being relatively better among the bad is still bad,Negative
You know everyones shitting on AirAsia but honestly you get what you pay for Theyre great for getting around on the cheap as long as you dont expect the treatment youd get as a First Class Singapore Airline golden ticket passenger,Positive
i mean pay n get shit servisfinnee thats fair pay and get worse roi than gentingyea rather go to genting,Negative
I might be a lucky one or probably I dont get mad easily but maybe because Ive been using flexi premium something when I use AA and all was good I dont know Been using AA and MAS interchangeably whenever I favour either one for time and occasion be it domestic or international flights It has been pleasant tho I experienced delayed on both Count your blessings they say Probably this is one of mine,Positive
You get what you pay for,Neutral
Lets see the managements are shit and the business are shit,Negative
I bought tickets to Bali before Covid used MAS they allowed me to extend credit until it was ready to fly Finally managed to use the credit in 2022 3 years later Meanwhile Ive heard only horror stories from AirAsia on the impossible to claim refund for Covid related cancellation,Neutral
It just seems to me that a lot of people are complaining that they received credits instead of a cash refund that they wanted and then in protest they keep fighting for a cash refund until the credits expired or they just refuse to use AirAsia again and then the credits expired Personally I was in the same boat I had flights booked with AirAsia before covid and I received credits I just used those credits when flights opened up again I believe those credits were valid for 3 years more than enough time to book new flights when the world opened up again though obviously flights were more expensive then since everyone wanted to travel again after 2 years of closed borders,Neutral
I flew air Asia a fair bit in the last year also took a red eye to Japan on their lie flat bed offering It was great Mostly on time and the hard product of the lie flat bed is great value for money,Positive
I think it may also be the point that if you go for slightly longer distance flight they are not exactly budget anymore You will need to add on for luggage inflight meal tax and service charge etc the end cost of your flight will be at most 300 cheaper than MAS with all the cost already included THEN you get the budget airline service along with it Personally experienced that I bought return flight to south korea and it was cheaper on MAS by rm30 compared to AirAsia,Negative
Zero leg space,Negative
AA is true to being budget in facilities but not by price Seats cramped Ive been on better budget airlines with decent leg space,Negative
Airasia and their owner is a the epitome of how destructive capitalism has been to our society Less I say the better,Negative
I have flown AK yes guys its AK AA is American Airlines and its long haul subsidiary D7 a number of times They can be a hit or miss depending on your luck The ground staff from their subsidiary GTR sucks One time when I did not pass their scales instead of helping guide me to check my bag they simply abandoned me And some of their agents are quite indifferent and cold though I alao have some good experience with some of the staff Their cabin crew are also a mixed bag The junior FAs which makes up the bulk of FAs on AK seem to be there just to enjoy and not take their job seriously On one flight I noticed a passenger asking for assistance for connections at KLIA the FA simply just shake her hands while appearing clueless without asking for her to refer to the ground staff for help On the other hand on D7 which tend to have senior FAs the cabin crew are more helpful and professional The last time I flew with them to Hokkaido they were very attentive Though that maybe in part due to my dad being a pilot for them so the crew know him hence the special treatment But I can say the cabin crew on D7 seem to take their job seriously unlike AK But in general AK and by extension D7 can be either good or bad depending on your luck But I can say they really suck on ground staff communication and for most people refund But on the air it can be quite decent for an LCC The FB selection at least help make up their flaws,Neutral
I didn’t get a refund back during Covid when my flight got cancelled and my past experience with air asias flight delays made me never get any tickets from them again Scoot is way better,Negative
When you see Tony and a snake you whack tony,Negative
Long time AirAsia customer and havent been stiffed yet HOWEVER its always stressful flying with AirAsia because I have to constantly check if they rescheduled which has happened to those I know Some have arrived at the airport 10 hours too early because of rescheduling,Neutral
You are really comparing AA to low cost airlines in europe I have never had my flight cancelled whilst travelling in europe but have had my flight cancelled 2 times by AA because “not enough passenger”,Negative
AA as a budget airline is doing very fine Try other budget airlines then say AA is bad Please do not compare a mamak stall to a Michelin 23star restaurant,Positive
I compare AirAsia with what they were ten years ago Back then their services arent perfect but at very least they aint the flaming trashcan they are right now When I flew with MyAirlines I had high hopes for them as they reminded me of AirAsia of old If they were to maintain that kind of service they couldve been a very good alternative airline to AirAsia Sadly they went bankrupt after being in operations for less than a year,Neutral
NGL I miss myairlines That’s cheap and gave AA a run for their money when MyA just started,Neutral
What kind of service do you mind elaborate I see no difference compared to 10 years ago except the stupid Bo chatbot,Negative
Bo is fucking dumb,Negative
Delay mostly caused by plane condition weather condition and the previous flight delayed What AA actually create hates are irresponsible false advertising long distance flight and sometimes more expensive than flag carriers,Negative
Airasia has strict rule about their cabin baggage weight and size ANNOYING,Negative
Yeah it had gotten stricter Now they sizing up your backpacks,Neutral
It’s horribly cramped I fly Malaysia Airlines premium economy always now unless for short flights,Negative
I used to prefer MA but theyre using boeing and I rather reach the ground safely,Negative
Tinder chatbots send nudes AAs doesnt,Neutral
Air asia has won best low cost carrier 11 years in a row I have flown several in Europe and Australia Air asia are fine,Positive
I have flown with them four times in the past month on my trip around Asia Easy and cheap if you don’t have to rebook or reschedule their entire customer service team is an AI chat bot that is absolutely useless To get from point A to point B for cheap it’s great but if you have any rescheduling concerns I would not recommend I had them change one of my flights and move it 18 hours later to the next day which would not work with my travel plans and I couldn’t for the life of me get a refund or reschedule I had to do a charge back with my credit card company to finally get the money back,Neutral
I’ve flown with them a few times Flights were fine but one time I paid a bit extra to get a preassigned seat and they gave me a seat in the very last row of the plane lol Also last I knew their customer service consists of a chatbot If there is a way to bypass it I did not figure it out To be fair the chatbot did successfully rebook my flight for free after an unacceptable schedule change,Positive
Youre lucky They changed my flight and I used the chat bot to change my flight for free But something near the end went wrong because it ended up keeping the new flight time I did not want and now Im having an incredibly hard time contacting customer service to fix this issue I WILL NEVER USE AIR ASIA AGAIN,Negative
No na okay yes Usually on time rebooking in case of time change or cancellations works no experience with customer service are strict with weight Side note dirt cheap tickets but expensive checked bags 7kg carry on limit with the option to buy more weight I think food options range from decent to atrocious if you want to eat something from their menu prepay for it its fairly priced and go for either the Biryani or Nasi Lemak less than desirable leg space but its ultimately an ULCC and for short flights or for anyone thats not over 510 andor 200lb it should be manageable Edit also has annoying credit card surcharges,Neutral
No it’s terrible they cancel most flights that they sell early on which makes it impossible to plan any kind of trip with them No customer service only a retarded bot Avoid,Negative
Same super low budget experience as Cebu Pacific honestly same high risk of cancellation and lack of backup options same nickel and diming for seats and food,Negative
Have flown with AirAsia about 20 times both internally in Malaysia and externally about 8 times Cheap flights if you have only carry on Usually good time keeping Seats arent very comfortable but none of the cheap seat airlines are any more The mobile app is clunky and annoying They fly everywhere now even the UK and NZ Short haul fine long haul take food and drink and something warm to wear because and just like anything Malaysian the airconditioning is usually overboard,Neutral
Our outbound flight from Manila to Bohol was rescheduled an hour earlier but ended up 2 12 hours late Our inbound flight to Manila was rescheduled on the last minute to two hours later Ticketing counter was closed inside the terminal I will not book with AirAsia again,Negative
Air Asia Philippines has better airport facilitiescompared to Cebu Pacific Butthats true the inflight crew are shitty and sarcastic,Negative
The worst airline experience I have ever had Do not be fooled by the cheap prices cause it will cost you so much hassle stress and even money on missing flight and buying checkin baggage This is what happened to me my first time booking them and i will never ever do so again They also have the worst airline staff attitude there is no customer service at all with these people no value or empathy being shown to their customers in fact they even make your experience deliberately terrible Its like they hate their job and it reflects so much in how they treat theor customers I would rather get trapped in the middle of nowhere and wait for other available flights than book this airline again,Negative
For me Air Asia is good when it comes to price But about the service of some flight attendants NOT REALLY GOOD They keep on smiling and being friendly to those passengers that look rich Especially foreigners But for those Filipino passengers they think that are not welloff they are not good They discriminate some poor Fililipino They are checking the boarding pass and treat them like a beggar Bad experience,Negative
We’ve been trying to get someone to call us back for 4 days we leave messages and they don’t return the calll  I guess you but cheap you get cheap service Terrible,Negative
Took AA X from Osaka to KUL Flight was good and flew on time Seats width are smaller and it was hard for me tl sleep Food was quite mediocre though and its advisable that you book it pre flight,Neutral
Worst airline everFirst of all the crews are all not well trained secondly the plane are not well maintainedFor your safetydont ever take airasia Usually before take offmost airline crews will do safety check but my latest flight with them they DID NOT checked When the flight are fullthe crews dont bother to check on compartment space whether items are well kept instead letting passengers to put baggage under the seatsimagine during turbulence like the latest SQ321 case The crews are not professional and well trained I doubt they have the ability to take care of the safety onboard,Negative
Customer service is terrible I will never fly with them again They don’t refund either,Negative
Got more than three hours delayed on each of the flights i had with them If you want to wait in the airport more than the flight time they are the best,Negative
Thai Air Asia review I just wrote On the outbound flight I checked in online and was given three adjacent seats for me and my kids For the return flight the app assigned us three separate rows Contacted Air Asia and sent proof that my son has autism and said that he needs to sit with me In under an hour they denied the request for us to sit together So I had to pay for new seats App did not accept my Thai credit card again so had to use my UK one and incur further charges They are the Ryanair of the east minus the shirtless tattooed bellends but Ill continue to use them as the flights are cheap and frequent,Neutral
Air asia such a bullshit airways my flight was suppose 755 AM and now delayed 920 Am Date20072024,Negative
Air Asia just changed where we land in Thailand Want to land where arranged Do not use this airline No customer service and as a family of 3 we had to book another airline 100 our cost,Negative
Not recommended Staff really cheaper and malaysian in staff too rude,Negative
Air Asia the worst,Negative
I booked a flight right before Covid for March 2020 never saw a refund or credit So they still have my money,Negative
AirAsias herbal with the baggage I watched them throw my bag into the plane and it came out all ripped up and torn dont fly with these idiots And they wouldnt do anything about it,Negative
Its not Stay away from it The customer support is the worst ever it basically makes your life so hard that you end up giving up the money they owe you Worst experience I ever had with a travel company,Negative
The Worst Airline in the world They are robbers They have the strangest policy The excess baggage weight charge is 231kg And because they have a 7kg carryon weight limit If your carryon weight is more than that you cant just pay for the access weight You have to transfer items to the checkin bag If you cant because your checkedin bag doesnt have space or whatever the reason might be they also will make you check the carryon bag Now you will be forced to pay 7kg of carryon weight since you have to check in the carryon bag This is robbery They corner you They dont offer any other solution You will end up paying more than double the ticket price There are a ton of other affordable reasonable airlines in Asia that will give you solution options If I could give them a negative star I would I have flown Spirit other cheap airlines around the world no one robs you the way they do,Negative
Air Asia is the most incompetent airlines Ive ever flown I am surprised they managed to stay in the air Find another airline,Negative
Air Asia is the most incompetent airlines Ive ever flown I am surprised they managed to stay in the air Find another airline,Negative
Just had a bad experience in Cambodia the customer service agent said my carry on was 28 kg over and the cost was 69 usd Their credit card machine did not work that day They told me to go get cash from atm no receipt was given At the gate I saw numerous bags that looked over 7kg I believe it was all a scam I would avoid this carrier The agent told me at the gate they would be checking everyone Duh there are no scales at the gate He also said f I did it online four hires earlier it was 24 usd but it was now three hours outside of the flight Avoid avoid avoid worst rude staff ever and I am an elite flier I should have known better,Negative
I flew Air Asia from KL to Siem Reap Terminal at KL is super crowded Carryon luggage was weighed before the flight They are strict with bag weight Flight was delayed by 2 hours No snacks or water on the flight Customer service was budget Seems to have gotten worse over the past 7 years since the last time I flew with them,Negative
Asia air is the worst I have never seen such unprofessionalism in my life and I thought Spirit airlines was bad Asia air takes the cake Flight attendants hurriedly passed out the food and proceeded to go to the back of the plane They spent the entire flight talking very loudly amongst themselves I could hear them talking the whole ride I sat in the middle of the plane When I went to get my baggage my suitcase and my friends suitcase were both damaged Asia air offered us 16 USD as compensation So laughable I should have flown Singapore Airlines Singapore airlines were cheaper too Never again flying Asia air,Negative
Do NOT take AirAsia Literally THE MOST STRICT airline for baggage weight I have taken over 50 flights and never had a problem with my carry on and personal item But on my 28 flight they stopped me at the gate and made me pay 46 to check a bag AND they had the nerve to talk behind my back and call me “stupid and weird” Absolute trashy airline I will never take again,Negative
My flight was 2 hours late and so I missed the connecting flight They want to charge me money to bookchange to another flight The Air Asia Manager January 18th 2025 at 830 PM Don Muang Airport Thailand was extremely rude She refused to give me her supervisors contact information She told me to look it up online I wont be using Air Asia again and will file a chargeback with my creditdebit card company Many people dont know they can file a chargeback Air Asia will probably have to pay a chargeback fee and will lose the payment as they should I paid and got NOTHING,Negative
If you are flying without check in baggage it may be cheap Even on international flights with air Asia you have to pay No check in allowance I think its best buy from other airlines if you have check in baggage These addons cost more than the flight itself If you are traveling only with 7kg its cheap,Neutral
Be very careful when you order from the Air Asia online platform Unless you’re very careful they will include all kinds of insurance and other add ons that you didn’t agree to Very deceptive They would be subject to class action lawsuits in many countries,Negative
One of the worst company I know with SriLankan airline The website and the chat bot is a joke Really If you choose them pray to not have any small issue,Negative
Don’t fly this airline it’s worse than spirit airlines They damage your bag and don’t care about you at all Had a durable carryon that got shredded in one 50 min flight,Negative
I’ve flown them many times usually ok not comfortable food is bad,Neutral
Cheap Bad There isn’t margin for ‘good’ Frequently delayed everything cost extra not comfortable,Negative
Air Asia is very budget friendly and they are pretty good at least way better than the Philippine Airlines which I really recommend you to avoid at all costs,Positive
Air Asia is one of the few airlines that I have vowed to never fly again They no longer offer telephone support and will not respond to emails So if anything goes wrong with your booking theres nothing you can do about it I booked them for a flight from Indonesia to KL Air Asia changed both outbound and return flight times So I had to cancel the flight since the new times would no longer work for me I managed to get a human on their chat But they said Id have to get the agent I booked through to cancel it The agent tried to reach Air Asia for over 2months and was never able to get a response Ultimately the agent refunded my money and ate the cost,Negative
Wrost service ever in my entire life Harassing customers unnecessarily,Negative
Yes for the price Its a no frills airline If you want after sales service food entertainment and on time flights pay the extra 1000 and fly Thai or Singapore Otherwise stop complaining Service isnt free Theyre safe,Positive
But their customer service is very bad Their AI chatbot Ask Bo is useless And its really hard to get a refund from them,Negative
They are wonderful when they worksB,Neutral
If Im going to be adding on baggage anyway wouldnt it be better if I take MAS instead AAs baggage and food prices are way too expensive Plus the fact that they started self check in and baggage drop offs in KLIA2 and mandatory weight checks for carry on items,Negative
Just flew with them Chicken biryani was RM20 and the portion was small For return flight I just bought stuff before going to the airport made myself full,Negative
Ive checked out some dates The layover times in Singapore are just ridiculously long plus theyre overnight til the next flight There are a few layovers which are at least 3 to 4 hours but have to pay a few extra hundred,Negative
No way Jose Theyre lowly scums Ill still use them but only because no one else can compete on price,Neutral
Literally the least shitty out of the shitty airlines segment Bravo at clearing that shit height bar,Neutral
AirAsia is fine if the flights are not full and short Been happy with some of the deals Mighty Travels is sending me Kuching especially,Positive
Malaysian airlines feels like a luxury when compared to airasia,Negative
Depends on your personal preferences and money situation For me Im comfortable with Airasia if its flying short haul 3 hours and below anything above that especially the 7 hours to Aussie East Asia Ill prefer the full service carriers,Neutral
AA still owes me money lol,Negative
Ok ill just say this I was taking a total of 4 flights from East Msia to West Msia Of the 4 flgiths 3 were airasia Of the 3 1 was delayed by an hour 2 were rescheduled twice 8am to 10am to 4pm When i wanted a refund they put me on hold for 4 hours to speak to a person who promptly told me that I cant get a refund to my bank but Im stuck in the airasia eco system with their shitty Big account or something So i get credit with them which I cannot withdraw My other flight was MAS was delayed by an hour due to some GPS fuckery 1 hour plus flight but got given a meal sat more comfortably and could watch movies Maybe im an old fart but I cant deal with AirAsias miserly shit I swear the seats are more cramped the aircon is less powerful and the CS service is so much worse,Negative
With Airasia you gotta ask yourself do you feel lucky,Neutral
I usually go with AA cause I’m broke af even though I know flying with AA is like Russian roulette So I usually make my plans with delays and reschedule in mind,Neutral
MAS I have many bad experience with AirAsia,Negative
MAS without a doubt Havent flown AirAsia for years probably since 2018 or 2017 Previously bought a return ticket with AirAsia in 2020 and decided to burn it cause too lazy with the refund process,Negative
Neither Use a proper airline certainly not thieving bstards airasia though,Negative
There were lots of cancelled flights over the last two years and refunds only come in the form of future plane tickets for flights that may or may not be cancelled,Neutral
I used to travel a lot between East and West Malaysia using AA preCovid and it was not too bad a few delay here and there but never a cancelled flight but post Covid is when the shitshow began with all these rescheduled and cancelled flights,Negative
For all the complaints rationally if you are not in hurry just stick with AA it just like one hour flight You can risk it,Neutral
I would rather swim than to ever give AA another cent of mine,Negative
Thats why Im holding off on travelling overseas at the moment and wait till the situation is more stable if Im gonna be taking AA,Neutral
Malaysia Airlines for sure In my recent trip 2 out of 3 flights with AirAsia were rescheduled multiple times so I cancelled and went with MAS and FireFly The one remained on time with AirAsia flew on time and flight itself was OK However MAS planes are far more comfortable,Negative
Please go with MAS AA has fucked people too many times Ive seen them rescheduled my friends flight quite a few times now this year that is not ok and not normal,Negative
AirAsia reschedule my flight that I book months in advance Unacceptable Once the flight is booked its booked You cant just reschedule the cheaper tickets just because someone else bought it at a later time with higher prices,Negative
I dont think its that its more that they pretend to offer lots of flights cant fill them all to make it worth it and then start rescheduling so they can fill a single flight,Negative
MAS or any other airlines that fly to Thailand I rarely use AA unless thats the only carrier available that fit my time but seeing my brothers flight had been rescheduled all the time Ill steer away from AA If there is no other carrier than AA I probably take a train or drive lol thats how much Ill avoid AA I dont have the patience to deal with them and their stupid ava,Negative
Unpopular opinion I would take the chance since you said both have bad reviews I flew from KL to Phuket in January when not many people were traveling yet AirAsia didnt cancel my flight although there were less than 20 passengers I recently flew back to KL from Chiang Mai there were no problems with my flight I guess I was lucky I have flown with AirAsia a lot preCovid and since Covid around Malaysia and Southeast Asia Some of my AirAsia flights might have been delayed or rescheduled but so did some of my flights with other airlines so Ive had far worse experiences with other airlines,Positive
Just got back from phuket in june Flight to there was with AA Flight delayed by an hour cause plane arrived late Very unlikely they will reschedule a flight when its overseas flight since have to deal with aviation authority on the other side,Neutral
General question for the comments section do airasias international flights have the same issues now as its domestic flights Ive taken aa flights to thailand and singapore before with no issues but that was prepandemic Since they only schedule 1 or 2 flights a day for international routes I doubt they do the whole secretly put everyone on one flight thing,Neutral
No issues with international flight,Positive
Airasia is on my black list I believe that its an airline with low safety standards and poor training Aircrash of Air Asia 8501 was caused by incompetency of captain and poor communication between captain and first officer Their training is very poor on communication when their flight crew comes from all over the world One pilot was pulling up and the other pilot is pushing down which cancelled inputs to the plane as the plane fall from the sky They also have quite a few incidents of runway excursions and burst tyres These are largely attributed to pilot mistakes and poor cockpit resource management And you see these categories of incidents most common in low end airlines in Africa and former CIS countries All Air Asias are the same as the same technical and management services are delivered across the different Air Asias They are set up in this way for ringfencing liabilities and assets that help in aircraft financing arrangements and they get different ICAO codes and treated differently from being the same airlines when they fight for airport slots and routes The only LCC I like is Jetstar Their products are higher quality and they have solid engineering team backed by Qantas They are always on time too,Negative
My dad is a pilot and we do not fly Air Asia for all the reasons you said above Especially now after years of limited revenue and high cost cutting it’s more risky than before I have a work trip to a neighbouring country soon and the cheapest fare was Air Asia I’m topping up the difference to fly Scoot You can fly many times and nothing goes wrong You can fly one time and nothing goes right I fly multiple times a month for work and I’m super particular Paying a little more for safety and service when something doesn’t go right is always worth it for me,Negative
My recent flights to Malaysia weren’t delayed and seemed quite alright But one was annoyingly rescheduled 5 hours earlier to 630am for some reason which made for an ungodly start time,Neutral
Yeah theyre reliable they get the job done for much cheaper ticket prices best LCC in the SEA region much better than scoot is what Ive been hearing,Positive
Safe yes reliable no I booked AirAsia for a weekend trip to Langkawi last month and they rescheduleddelayed my flights like 5 times The most annoying part was when they cancelled my return trip back to sg got so had to book another flight with a layover in KL and that too got delayed super last minute Would probably avoid flying with them even if they are considerably cheaper than other budget airlines,Negative
AirAsia is quite reliable They used to be the biggest budget airline in the region precovid not sure abt now I have flown with AirAsia very often before the pandemic No complaints,Positive
Yes Coming from Australia is actually hilarious how on time Air Asia is both international and domestically in Thailand I’d be careful about Philippines Air Asia but that’s mainly because Manila airport is a shitshow,Neutral
Yes cheaper if you dont need checked in baggage,Neutral
I fly with AirAsia several times per year including to and from KL Ive never experienced any delays or cancellations Ive never been on this particular route though,Positive
i use airasia quite often many times this year even the routes Krabi Bangkok KrabiKL never had a problem will always book again with them and the price is crazy low,Positive
I think I bought like 20 AirAsia domestic flights this year never had any issues whatsoever I wish I could say the same about my UA flights back in the State,Positive
Ive flown Air Asia dozens of times domestically and internationally never had any material delays other than 1530 mins sort of thing As opposed to the shit shows that are Qantas and Jetstar,Positive
Flights were all on time and departed and arrived as scheduled so not too bad Didn’t have much customer service interaction so not much to comment there,Neutral
No issues at all Can’t remember the price honestly but I got the package deal with insurance and meals as that worked out to be cheaper,Positive
I used airasia in Malaysia a few times Just be sure to read the baggage weight rules theyll most likely weigh your bags if they suspect youre over the limit Otherwise it was fine,Positive
I flew with them from Da Nang to Siem Reap it was fine We were swapped from an ATR to the A320 which cut the travel time which was nice,Positive
Air Asia is fine,Positive
yeah it is fine,Positive
Air Asia is shit Any carrier over air Asia if there is an available option,Negative
If your objective is only to reach the destination then air Asia is fine If your objective is to reach on time then avoid them Flight delays are lot more common than in Malaysian,Neutral
My most wierd experience in Air asia was where they left the Captain Pilot in Sydney airport The cabin door were closed and planned for take off Then we saw the stewardesses running back and forth and asking to each other if they saw the captain Then they conculded they left the captain outside the plane Bout 15 minutes later they reopen the cabin door for this captain to enter,Neutral
People crap on AirAsia all the time but they are really the most responsible and reliable low cost carrier that I’ve used Definitely the best in Asia and I’ll rank it higher than the ones in Europe,Positive
There seems to be a perception that AirAsia is worse than Malaysia Airlines when it comes to plane maintenance I guess lower fares makes people think AirAsia maintains their plane less than Malaysia Airlines,Neutral
I fly a lot and from what I know AA take their aircraft maintenance very seriously Thats because they are running on such a tight schedule where theres very little plane on standby They are a low cost carrier and they want their aircraft to be as productive as possible That might be true as I fly more on AA than MAS Ive gotten aircraft with broken aircond on MAS twice but it never happened on AA,Positive
Was recently on AirAsia flight While on the ground the aircond wasnt turned on due to inoperational APU Passengers began to sweat I heard one guy next to me said why the crew let us in when the problem should have been fixed first However after the main engines are turned on aircond was turned on for the rest of the flight I am not someone in aircraft operation and maintenance But I can see the relevance here Firstly the problem can be solved instantly if the engines are turned on before letting passengers enter the aircraft However that could pose risk to everyone when walking pass by rotating turbofan metres away Secondly I think this is a problem that deemed not serious enough to warrant flight cancellation Yes passengers might be fuming But in the end the aircraft itself can be flown and the aircond is turned on for the rest of the flight with only a slight 20 minutes departure delay,Neutral
Air asia has a large fleet so they easily have spare planes in case one breaks down this is why sometimes i prefer AA They actually can be quite reliable,Positive
Honestly I’ve heard cases where AA has super long or frequent delays so this time it was a pleasant surprise,Positive
AirAsia’s fleet is all airbus so no,Negative
Typical AirAsia flight And dont get me started on the inflight service But other airlines are way more expensive,Neutral
I flew with Air Asia in Thailand last year and I had some of the same anxieties you did The flight was perfectly fine modern and clean plane friendly and professionalseeming crew and a smooth and ontime flight No different than any number of shorthaul flights I’ve taken in the US and Europe I only took one flight with them during my trip but I was with friends who’d flown with them a bunch and had nothing bad to report You may have already found this in your research but Air Asia is actually several different airlines operating under the same brand name The Air Asia affiliate that had a crash in 2014 was the Indonesian one Thai Air Asia has never had an accident You are orders of magnitude safer on an Air Asia flight than on a 15 hour bus ride in Thailand and Cambodia,Positive
“Chat with Bo” What a joke,Negative
YupI wished that Bo was real so I could knock him out I tried to use Bo but it was incredibly frustrating,Negative
It’s crazy that they have Zero customer service I am surprised more companies havent gone that way Humans are expensive Do countries force them to have customer service lines Air Asia is the worst airline I have ever flown pay the extra 50 to fly anyone but them,Negative
Same happened to me during COVID19 never got refunded Theyre a scam,Negative
Refunds were basically impossible but I managed to get credit twice during covid Once during the lockdown and again last year when my wife had covid and could not travel Second time they did need confirmation documentation from a hospital which might have been an issue if my wife didnt work at a hospital,Neutral
Im happy you were able to get something back from them Based on other anecdotes and reviews I dont want to risk trusting them again by trying to use the credit just to have them screw me again,Negative
I avoid them when there is another carrier on the route Unfortunately air Asia has a monopoly on kkccnx and hkt at the moment so I will fly them,Negative
Yes Exactly or they’re hoping that u realize how much they suck and will book on another airline meanwhile they keep 100 of your money and all the other suckers who were dumb enuff to book with them In the end only they win,Negative
Good luck AirAsia customer support is bad even by the standards of discount airlines,Negative
I booked a flight in July 2021 it was cancelled and I still havent received the refund I got a case number and every time I checked its standard blabla saying they are processing it,Negative
Update they refund me today So in total 26 months Dont give up hope,Neutral
Learnt my lesson dont be cheap and take AA Worst customer service,Negative
Actually I swore off AA a long time ago but a friend of mine booked thru them to keep it simple I booked thru them too I argued against it but in the end it was easier to take the same flights I absolutely will never fly with them again,Negative
Incredibly unprofessional and frustrating,Negative
I have a different problem nothing major but they wont allow us online check in and have to go to the counter for our flights from bangkok to danang Went on to check and found it frustrating and the wee gimp BO done my nut in,Negative
That bot Bo will make you go insane,Negative
AirAsia worked perfectly for us as did Vietnam air and Cambodia air As with all travel be flexible and build in long layovers if you are concerned,Positive
AirAsia’s great as long as you go in understanding it’s not JAL the snacks and soda are not free there’s no lounge etc Their “everything included” package often still comes in cheaper than a legacy airline’s cheapest ticket We flew AirAsia from Sydney to Auckland last month in businessclassstyle pods for something like 250 USD per person It was terrific for what it was,Positive
zero incident the last 8 days Keep up the good work,Positive
According to Google the only budget airline offering direct flights between CNX and HAN is AirAsia Thai Airways do offer it as well but the air fares may not be as desirable for you For a 1½h flight though I think AirAsia works fine,Neutral
Ive used AirAsia a few times in the past and never had any problems with them Ive used them for domestic flights in Thailand and internationally to Malaysia and Cambodia I hope you find an alternative but for me Id be happy to use them,Positive
I mean its low cost for a reason Its way easier to put up with accessible pricing middling customer service rather than not being able to fly at all from exorbitant pricing,Neutral
They really live up to their tagline everyone can fly I wont complaint much bout AA because it helped me tick off many travel wishlist,Positive
For every million passengers carried Malaysia Airlines recorded the highest number of registered complaints with 199 complaints followed by Batik Air with 167 complaints and AirAsia with 95 complaints Needed to repost this again the editor needs to know they have the most complaints obviously because of their market share,Neutral
They really are the world’s best low cost airline Good for the consumers but terrible for its shareholders,Positive
As with anything in Air Asia they will make sure you dont enjoy whatever you pay for Aint it,Negative
If its Air Asia just say no Never trust them,Negative
Its just a gimmick When you want to redeem that time there wont be available flight at the desired rate on your preferred datedestination etc,Negative
Lmao I almost not able to break even my ROI when I last purchase their pass Never again OP you need to search for past posts There are discussion about this,Negative
Better just buy ticket straight,Neutral
why does this keep coming up isnt it already well known AirAsia is a scammer company that somehow gets away with it Its pretty obvious to me that they introduced the MOVE pass without ever intending to fulfill it for most people,Negative
Ill throw it away even if I get it for free Not gonna support that Tony a Hole,Negative
True I brought it and instantly regret,Negative
Agreed I havent been able to use it at all Flights booked out so far in advance,Negative
Thanks for the review Air Asia straight up ripped me off a few years ago charging me for checked bags then claiming I never paid even though there was an obvious record that I did Customer service was totally useless I avoid the airline completely now unless it’s the only option on the route I don’t mind paying a few bucks to avoid Air Asia,Negative
Air Asia is the most shameless and dishonest airline Ive ever flown Theyre the only airline I absolutely refuse to fly,Negative
They are awful their support is a really poorly coded ChatBot its basically impossible to talk to a real person I booked a flight with them they took my money but I never got confirmation Should have been easy to fix but was awful I had to go to the airport to try and fix it and even the agents on the desk could not do anything Id never fly with them again either tldr Air Asia suck giant donkey dick Do not use,Negative
Did you ever fly Ryanair or Spirit The airlines which charge you 40 for bullshit like printing your boarding pass In my experience AirAsia is not too bad for a lowcost airline except for their complete lack of customer support,Neutral
I literally just flew Ryanair from Dublin to Amsterdam other than a couple of loud drunks on the plane I think the experience with Air Asia is still worse,Negative
They rescheduled my flight to KL four times Was meant to get there 3pm and instead got there 1am,Negative
Air Asia told me I booked a return ticket for 7 years ahead of time when I flew Phuket to Chiang Mai It was physically impossible to book a return flight 7 years in advance on their website They refused to accept it was their error and was forced to pay a premium on the day to get home As others have said shameless company,Negative
To be fair their unlimited pass domestic in 2020 was an incredibly good deal but that was an exceptional situation when each flight was halfempty anyway,Neutral
AirAsia is the master of the catch So many damn little tricks,Negative
One of the worst airlines Had a typo on the name they said it wasn’t changeable Would refund me only 15 of the ticket but not the extra baggage I already paid for and I’d have to repurchase if there was a seat available of course there’s a fucking seat available I would have to pay again for the check in bag so it would end up essentially just paying double for 1 ticket,Negative
Ah I saw this on tiktok yesterday too some people were posting their air asia flights were rebooked without telling them etc sounds utterly insane to me,Negative
ITT People bitching about an airline that will fly you for 30,Neutral
Super pass was alright until everyone started flying again haha Now I cant use it at all,Negative
Jetstar is just a bogan missle AirAsia is better but Scoot is the best,Neutral
AirAsia They dont have the same problems with cancelations the staff are usually lovely and while its a lowcost carrier not the worst seats Also not expensive to pick a seat in a better part of the plane They also have excellent connections to various parts of Thailand if you dont want to fly into Bangkok,Positive
Jetstar AirAsia and Scoot are similar in a way LCCs So they will all nickel and dime you to death if you let them But Scoots ontime performance seems better than Jetstar and Thai AirAsia and you can earn miles for the KrisFlyer programme of Singapore Airlines You do however need to transit via Changi Airport which is a good airport to transit in but you may dislike that AirAsia X the long haul arm of AirAsia has better food among the three in my view but this is subjective and flies direct to BKK from SYD while Jetstar is kinda meh but lets you earn points for the Qantas frequent flyer programme but its SYD longhaul flight to BKK has a stopover at MEL to pick up more passengers before it goes to BKK,Neutral
I opt for AirAsia unless the fare is significantly cheaper which it rarely is with Jetstars add ons The staff are nicer and maybe it’s in my head but I find the seats slightly roomier Plus Quiet Zone and Fastpass are invaluable to me whenever it’s available,Positive
AirAsia probably has a slightly higher chance of your flight not being cancelled and the food was pretty good pre covid when i flew them last The seat will be horrible on both I wouldn’t be rushing to fly either tbh both will be absolutely packed with bogans,Neutral
Both a bit shit but jetstar more so Every jetstar experience i have had is miserable On the other hand flow with airasia countless times and never had much of an issue I just remember them being hard to contact when i needed them,Neutral
Never airasia,Negative
Low cost carrier Airasia only when you dont mind the delay,Neutral
Thai AirAsia is the only one I used not very strict about carryon weight I actually never had my backpack weighed and I can assure you its yuuge Once or twice I saw some people arguing with the crew over luggage but I didnt pay attention if it was due to weight or other issues,Neutral
I prefer Air Asia personally everything is just a bit nicer than Jetstar especially the staff,Positive
Air Asia hands down Pre order the nasi lemak Way better food and pretty much always on time Oh but no in flight entertainment on AA so download shows to phone or iPad,Positive
Last time they cancelled one of my flights they didit was a couple of years ago They offered to get me on a flight 3 days later which would have meant that I missed my connecting flight so I got a refund and booked with another airline Yep not a great outcome but if I was with AirAsia i probably wouldn’t have got the refund,Negative
AirAsia Schedule before safety every day of the week,Negative
Air Asia Hands down Jetstar is trash Qantas is going down hill Air Asia at least has great service and attitudes towards their patrons,Positive
Jetstar every day of the week If you prefer substandard safety practices fly an Air Asia group airline,Negative
their quality of service is roughly the same personally ive never had any bad experiences with cebu pacific and air asia it really just depends on luck and circumstances,Neutral
AirAsia is better than Cebu Pac in my experience,Positive
I like that it is easy to communicate with Air Asia better,Positive
It doesnt matter theyre mostly the same in terms of quality,Neutral
I suggest booking your flight in Cebu Pacific because they offer free rebooking if your flight was canceled but in Airasia you have to pay to rebook your flight,Negative
No cancellations so far Only rescheduled or delays,Neutral
You cannot pay me to use AirAsia,Negative
If people pay me to use air Asia I 100 will do it lmao,Negative
Fair enough 12k can make a huge difference especially on a trip,Positive
I have taken AirAsia to Japan for a few times now so far the experience has been positive there are slight delays but nothing biggie The only problem with AA to haneda is the time landing near 10pm with custom and immigration is almost certainly that you will need to rush to the monorail before it’s close and reopen at 5am Usually I just spent the night at the airport LOL,Positive
did u stay overnight at hotel near airport or literally the in the airport is there a place to sleep there yeah air Asia flight time is quite frustrating since land late at night and u hav to plan prior on choosing hotels that have 24 hour check in really frustrating,Negative
but but airasia is kononya the most on time airline with 99 on time flights i remember there was one person even arguing with me that they publish their data and its true lol,Neutral
Lmao what was their justification for saying that they’re always on time Don’t tell me they’re on time based on their delayed schedule,Negative
thye retime flights right retiming means changing the scheduled departure time hence there is no delay in other words creative statistics,Neutral
Stay strong my flight is delayed by 4 hours too,Neutral
Evening flights always confirm delayed,Negative
Going to Macau for holiday next month and I was super pissed that the only direct flight was AirAsia Now Im fearing for the worst,Negative
Got a 5 hours delay today Gonna go to work without sleep,Negative
Protip If ever possible always try to go with the early morning flights especially for budget airlines like airasia This is because budget airlines operate on a very tight turnaround the amount of time they stay on the ground after landing before flying again in order to maximise flight time and revenue Each plane has their own daily schedule of their flights for the day and if any of those flights ends up delayed then it will cascade towards the following flights as well Thats why most delays tend to happen towards the evening rush hour like your picture If you have a early morning flight chances are thats the first scheduled flight of the day for that plane and the plane is usually parked at the airport the night before already so less likely of a delay,Neutral
Earlier this year I had to take a night flight from KK to KL Flight was delayed but no announcement made No update on the board no announcement nothing Made us worried and the AirAsia staff are completely useless Had to ask them directly and even so they did not want to acknowledgeadmit that the flight was delayed,Negative
same thing happened to me this year flying KL to BTU for my grandmothers funeral flight was supposed to be 5pm delayed till 7pm with no updates on the board but at least staff was upfront on the cause when asked the plane from cambodia was delayed,Neutral
Air asia 810 flights always get delay Malaysia airline 310 flights delay Garuda more or less same as malaysia airline Based on personal experience,Negative
My 1pm flight ok today,Neutral
yep in jakarta now waiting on a flight that was delayed twice,Negative
Never had a problem with them and theyre one of the airlines I trust most in Asia,Positive
They dont cancel often Theyre more likely to be late Theyre certainly worth it and are often the cheapest,Positive
Just flew with airasia from Bangkok KL and back and it was fine,Positive
Never take the last flight of the day so if they canceled it it will be next day flight,Negative
Have flown on them 30 times never had a single issue and they also have very affordable and good food options,Positive
Flew with them 7 times in a 10 month period and never had a problem Just watch out for the bag limit on carry on They sometimes check after you have checked into your flight At kl they check most bags before the gates Saying that I had about 12kg and just took out my camera and laptop and carried it separately Never had to pay extra,Positive
I have worked as a cabin crew at Air Asiayou can trust them its a good budget airline go for it,Positive
It’s quite unlikely they will cancel In my experience they do sometimes change the departure time a bit usually a month or more in advance but they won’t just suddenly stop flying the route,Neutral
Flew with them twice on my trip no problems at all,Positive
Budget airline you get what you pay for Other than that theyre fine,Neutral
Had 14 flights with them since June Only one was canceled Coming from Europe where Ryanair cancels usually 30 of my flights this is an awesomely low rate All the other 13 were on time if not even a few minutes early Service is good staff friendly Will use them whenever I can,Positive
They seem to have improved allot since the days they were banned in European airspace I remember the trips I took with them 15 years ago in old rundown planes Now they seem to have newer planes But as with any Asian budget airlines be prepared for very little leg space if your a tall westerner,Neutral
Just be aware they will strictly enforce the 7kg carry on limit at Siem Reap airport,Neutral
Just flew from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and from there to Hua Hin with AirAsia 0 Problems and on time Only thing is that in Economy Legroom is below average,Neutral
if you’re checking luggage make sure you prepay,Neutral
I just took AirAsia from Krabi to DMK and it was fine Note that the seat spaces are very small though much smaller compared to when we used Nok Air or Bangkok air and my husband who is 62 just barely fit just letting you know in case that is a factor for you,Neutral
In my experience earlier this month absolutely unreliable until the very last minute Nevertheless they are the best of an awful bunch I had better experiences with Malindo airlines and firefly not sure if these only operate in Malaysia but they were good Airasia changed my flights cancelled my flights for fun Wait till the last minute to book your flights if possible,Negative
If you booked in advance they will cancel your flight 2 weeks before and leave you to buy a last minute ticket with no refund for 60 days Up a creek Avoid if you can,Negative
Customer service sucks big time AI chat bot not helpful at all Doesn’t solve anything,Negative
It’s average I don’t remember anything particularly good or bad People who had a bad experience are more likely to share feedback,Neutral
Its fine Its just a flight Worst case you still land and do something else after 8 hours of mild disappointment,Neutral
I fly Air Asia a lot Their planes don’t have much leg room but they are also a budget airline You can usually pay extra for the seats with additional leg room I do this I have always found the Indonesian staff beautiful there’s probably as not much service as with Quanta’s but there’s a big fare difference too Air Asia is considerably cheaper so you get basic service from beautiful staff Take your iPad etc and load it up No entertainment on any of the flights I’ve taken You have to pay for your food too you can pre book them They charge 5 a meal No complimentary blankets either,Neutral
Its budget so theres that Also between varioud budget airlines I learned to fly Scoot instead because 1 higher carryon baggage allowance 2 less strict with weight limits Yeaaa I didnt think too much abt my last AirAsia flight in terms of legroom bc it was just one hr SGKL which naturally meant no inflight entertainment either,Neutral
Well I have no issue but I find a bit of hiccups during self baggage drop at the airport so I have to go over the counter Anyway I got to the airport 3 hours in advance of my flight so all the above hiccups can be settled on time and still get to walk leisurely around the airport Make sure you get all your passesproof of vaccination printed out Yes AIRASIA is bad But as long you pay a reasonable amount of air ticket ie not excessively cheaper than the other airlines your ticket would not get cancelreschedule Flight to Bangkok is quite busy so there is less likelihood they will get cancelreschedule or even if there is a delay it will be less than an hour delay,Neutral
Never had a problem with Air Asia,Positive
I appreciate your diligence but why Do you work for AirAsia This was a while ago I just had to pay so much out of my own pocket and AirAsia did nothing so I guess Im still a little salty about it,Negative
Just genuinely curious in your experience and I would have been angry as well Same thing kind of happened to me in Russia once with S7,Neutral
Had a relative who took yesterdays early morning flight from Penang to KLIA2 Supposed to take off at 7ish then pilot said there was some engine fault Waited for an hour on the plane for that to be fixed no refreshments given etc etc They dont give you any fucks Then took off reached KLIA2 we were there to pick him up After waiting so long with no updates from him I remarked to a cocar passenger that maybe the pilot couldnt land due to the heavy rain Apparently the pilot tried twice unsuccessfully The plane was redirected to Subang We thought wed wait at KLIA2 But gave up after being told that the damn plane would only take off from Subang like some hours later All this while no refreshments served If you wanted it pay for it They dont give you any fucks Net net the dude finally landed at KLIA at bout 12pm But we gave up and told him to find his own way home via KLIA ExpressLRTMRT He finally reached home at 230pm They dont give you any fucks Like some nyet once said it isnt Air Asia Its Air Ashit x200B ps Moral of the Story If you want to get to a destination where time is of the essence dont fly Air Asia They dont give a fuck about passengers since Tony Fernandez thinks he can abuse you since youre paying low fares,Negative
If you want to get to a destination where time is of the essence dont fly Air Asia My company only allows us to fly AA if there’s no other choice For some interSarawak flights they actually have better routes compared to MAS so we do use them but yeah they’ve fucked up enough that company had to make it a policy,Negative
I only have a small sample size parents and relatives flew from KL to Sabah a month ago flight to Sabah was delayed by like around 30 mins flight back to KL actually arrived early by 15 mins A friend flew to Langkawi a couple of months back and the flight arrived 15 mins earlier than expected as well Sister flew to Langkawi and it arrived on time It is because normally people with good experiences wont be posting all over social media which is why you tend to see bad reviews all over which is further magnified by the fact that they carry the most number of passengers in ASEAN Honestly if you are paranoid you can see the daily data for AirAsia flights on Google for your destinations they will say which flights are delayedontimeearly arrival then you can gauge whether they are actually reliable Ultimately it is a low cost carrier you get what you pay which is to get from point A to B,Neutral
Just took a return flights from Bangkok last week Pretty good The departing flight got delayed for few hours due to cascading effect due to bad weather but they provide us with Chicken Briyani Return flight is on time and actually arrived 20 minutes early Btw I had Etiqa360 insurance so I got some money due to the delay Can’t exactly complain,Positive
Sometimes ok sometimes have might have some unannounced delays of 1530mins I feel most of the MY based budget airline are having almost the same kind of issues,Neutral
I had a pretty epic delay from Penang KL where my parents drove back I flew back via firefly and by the time they reached home we were suppsoed to both arrive more or less around the same time I was still in the airport waiting area weather reasons so cant be helped I suppose,Neutral
Most Budget airlines does not include frills unless u pay extra,Neutral
AA forgot my prebooked meal once I didnt expect high standards from them since its a low cost airline,Neutral
Its fine most of the time,Positive
my wife started from penang uturn and pusing a bit somewhere in the middle of perak landing back in penang total flight time 59min delayed 1 hour push off and landing at klia2 55 minutes later no causes given whatsoever,Negative
Yeah flew with them It was very barebone I didnt expect anything else and was prepared for delays or other issues No problem One should not book a connecting flight thereafter or an excursion right after arrival If you approach this similar to using a bus that might be delayed or break down then its actually quite chill and not stressful,Neutral
Yes All this is well known but like so many you took the cheap fare Zero sympathy,Neutral
To be fair AirAsia has essentially a monopoly on some routes around Southeast Asia Its sometimes very difficult to find another airline that flies that exact route So Id have some sympathy particularly in the Philippines which tends to be a shit show to fly in general,Neutral
So you knew all of that and still booked them Also “Worst airline” is title for any airline here lol From airfrance to airasia frontier etc,Negative
Honestly flew Air Asia a dozen times and never had any problem But like others saidlow cost airlineyou need to be aware of the caveats,Positive
So you choose price over convenience You knew what you were buying LCC carrier doesn’t service and have a full suite of staff to take phone calls you can’t be paying Air Asia prices and expecting Singapore Airlines service Now you’re here to rant and complain Also they are not always delayed every day you know that there are official statistics that are published online that you can locate,Neutral
I mean the terms and conditions for that pass are so incredibly restrictive Im not sure why anyone who read the fine print would have bought the pass or how AirAsia are allowed to use the term unlimited given the variety of limits placed on how it can be used Just looking at a few of the Malaysia termshttpswwwairasiacomunlimitedengbtermsandconditionsUAPTnCMYEN nbsp you must book at least 14 days in advance nbsp you cannot have more than 3 unflown bookings at a time which by itself would really seem to wipe out any use of the word unlimited nbsp Embargo Period covers 60 days out of the year on which the pass cannot be used 30 October 2024 4 November 2024 All SoulsSaints Day Z2 19 December 2024 5 January 2025 Christmas and Year End Holidays All Carriers 24 January 2025 3 February 2025 Chinese New Year All Carriers 27 March 2025 6 April 2025 Hari Raya AKD7FDQZ 10 April 2025 20 April 2025 Songkran Festival AKD7FDQZ 15 April 2025 22 April 2025 Holy Week Z2 nbsp In addition to the Embargo Period the allocated zero base fare seats to be booked andor purchased by the Subscriber is limited for each flight and is further subject to availability In other words AA are within their rights to say that only Seat 15B is available for the zero base fare on each flight or even only on certain flights and they would appear to have held up their end of the bargain,Negative
These restrictions weren’t even a problem for me as I can travel almost any day out of the year but their hinky platform won’t even let you book even if flights are showing available,Neutral
I have the same issue I can travel any day and looked for flights all the way to November and none show as available not a single one I tried different destinations too to no avail,Negative
You should have done some research before buying it I was considered buying the pass when they were advertising it but a simple google research with some reviews about the limitations had me dissuade from it Like you dont find a single review of someone saying wow this pass is worth it all reviews say dont buy it,Negative
That’s blaming the victim The pass seems to be a scam,Negative
Theyve done this before and its always the same Its only usable if you are unemployed so you have 100 flexibility and you dont care at all where you fly Tawau to Bandung at 3am on a Tuesday One seat available with the pass Grab it,Neutral
AirAsia is a scammer company Honestly this isnt the first time they have sold this scam yet people continue to fall for it Sorry OP you pretty much just burned your money On the other hand I have the Malaysia Airlines flypass and it gives me just what I want 6 flights book or change anytime Ive had no trouble using it Lesson learned OP Stay away from Air Asia,Negative
To everyone As a Malaysian were sorry To AirAsia Fuck you We fly with you cause we have to not cause we want to,Negative
Some people just dont get learn or get smart do they,Negative
I instantly rolled my eyes so hard that it severed my optic nerves after I saw the advert There is no such thing as a good deal in Malaysia,Negative
Same with me Flexible to travel any day but even if there is any the savings of base fare is only RM6,Neutral
The whole company is a scam don’t understand why people still bother travel with them,Negative
I got my money wasted too About 1200 myr wasted I think Normal flight is about 540 myr and with the free unlimited its 460 hahahaha 80 MYR saving per flight Thats unbelievable,Negative
Has anyone had any good flights with the unlimited pass I used it a bit but never ever saved its price with the reduces flights I am in south east asia and am flexible If there is something good from Thailand or Malaysia let me Know,Neutral
it is a bad waste of money What they don’t tell you to use it you have to fly from KL so it doesn’t work from other cities Flights are usually not eligible for the discount and you still have to pay the airport tax which is most of the fare anyway I bought it in 2024 and haven’t been able to use it more than once or twice as flights are usually not available or more expensive paying to fly to KL first then to use it to my destination I highly regret buying it and don’t recommend anyone to buy it,Negative
Air Asia is a pretty nice airline Better than some of the European ones like British Airways or even KLM,Positive
I flew back to singapore via Kuala Lumpur w AirAsia earlier this week I was impressed to say the least Im never a fan of AirAsia btw Being Malaysian I never like them because of their reliability and also charge every single thing But that flight from Almaty to KL was gold Just one thing to note make sure you take the two seater One lane has 8 seats 2 on each side 4 in the middle Theres no entertainment nor power so you cant charge But get the meals to fill you in before the sleep Its about an 8 hour flight,Neutral
Yes correct At least I got notified But I need to say it must be under one same airlines which is AirAsia,Neutral
I don’t believe you need it if you’re transiting because you won’t go thru the immigration But since it’s digital and u can ask the air crew and do it when you arrive Or you can just do it anyway cos it won’t cost you money I didn’t need it cos I’m a Malaysian,Neutral
Yes very reliable and great airlines for the cost,Positive
Cuz it’s cheap It’s the language of money,Positive
Theyre cheap thats why I dont have any issues with them thomy whole experience have been ok so far,Positive
On normal days I still think quite expensive lols Rm150 for a single trip,Neutral
Its reasonable given the distance Jet fuel isnt subsidized lol,Neutral
The pandemic didnt just effect the grounded planes themselves The lay off in staff was another issue A lot of pilots that got cut had gone on to get other jobs Same with ground engineers I remember been told AA had cut off 60 of their pilots during the pandemic And as of a couple of months ago I think they were only back to 75 capacity in terms of pilots and ground staff,Neutral
Late night flights are the worst I would avoid if I can The chances of getting delayed are extremely high due to the backlogs from the entire day Anything before 5pm is relatively safe from any retimings,Negative
I commute regularly between Singapore to KL and AA is the cheapest option for me,Neutral
Duty free,Neutral
What Expecting a flight not to be rescheduled is now first class service Stupid,Negative
Or expecting an accessible customer service LMAO Go check their Air Asia website They make it so hard for you to reach a human ask for refund if your flight is delayed by hours,Negative
Cannot afford to refund surely cannot afford to hire customer service officers too ’,Negative
Their seatbelt is loose as fuck too,Negative
if they intervene too much and it starts becoming unprofitable the airline will either move base of operations away or shut down accessible air travel is a very big boon to the country for an airline not to be subsidized by the country quite a good thing,Neutral
Honey fly SQ,Neutral
Rub what Nasty,Negative
Because it is the cheapest if there are more low fare airlines exist they wont gonna fly with Air Asia,Neutral
Coz they can’t afford better,Negative
For me while AA is great due for cheaper price I feel like buying tickets for their flights is like gambling like playing a game of black jack and hope the luck is on your side,Neutral
I stopped using airasia Firefly ftw,Neutral
As the saying goes You get what you pay for Ive flown them several times and for the price still decent Its a basic experience and thats fine If you dont want to pay for full service airline then thats what you get,Positive
As a frequent traveller monthly balik kampung I dont mind the frequent rescheduling too much As long as it is on the same day mostly I am not that bothered Sometimes I welcome the rescheduling if AA Whybecause AA allows you to change the flight for free even the unaffected flight no other flight offers this So I just buy cheapest tickets months in advance cheap means I cannot get the times I want When I get the rescheduling email I just change it to the time I like originally,Positive
If they reschedule it you can change both to and fro flights for free,Positive
Wouldnt that make you a hypocrite Want to use and at the same time dislike it,Positive
I like learning new things,Positive
Sucks to be the customer Imagine you reach airport only to find out the check in counter has disappear and no staff to be seen you cannot fly,Negative
They are cheap you are ok with them until you get their infamous reschedule then you will think fuck that I rather pay more,Neutral
They cancelled our flight home at the start of COVID Impossible to find any service without going directly to KL airport Argued with us and got confrontational as if we had cancelled their flight Cherry on top was that they failed to send us a confirmation of cancellation so insurance rejected our claim We havent flown them since 2020 and never will again,Negative
When you dont understand the point,Neutral
1 Fares are cheap 2 Wide network coverage 3 Greater frequency than other airlines in Malaysia especially compared to MAB which scaled back domestic frequencies in favour of the more profitable international market 4 The power of marketing,Positive
But their customer service is very bad Their AI chatbot Ask Bo is useless And its really hard to get a refund from them,Negative
They are wonderful when they worksB,Positive
If Im going to be adding on baggage anyway wouldnt it be better if I take MAS instead AAs baggage and food prices are way too expensive Plus the fact that they started self check in and baggage drop offs in KLIA2 and mandatory weight checks for carry on items,Negative
Aa food is too expensive Its like rm10 a meal,Negative
Just flew with them Chicken biryani was RM20 and the portion was small For return flight I just bought stuff before going to the airport made myself full,Neutral
No way Jose Theyre lowly scums Ill still use them but only because no one else can compete on price,Negative
Out of all the airlines in SE Asia Air Asia is my favorite,Positive
Putting them above Singapore airlines is quite a statement,Negative
I only really used Singapore for long crossocean flights and I like Air Asia more than Scoot For flights inside SE Asia I prefer Air Asia,Neutral
Air Asia just won some award for being the best cheap Airline They are OK,Positive
The flight looks like it is only about 1 12 hr or so I don’t need to order a meal,Neutral
Definitely don’t need to It was a part of a package for us I was just letting you know,Neutral
air asia always flies they will get you to your destination however if you decide you want to change your itinerary your best and probably only option is to buy another ticket,Neutral
Took Air Asia from DMK to Changi Flight was fine Only complaint was that the leg room was minimal once I sat down Im 5ft8,Neutral
A good tip for that is to pay a little extra to sit in the front row Easy to get for most flights if you book early,Neutral
Air Asia are great in my experience flown them dozens of times without any issue Just make sure you are fully aware of your ticket conditions,Positive
Its a low cost airline ok for short flights with no ongoing connecting flights as they are often delayed,Positive
Took a return flight BKKChiang Mai with them last year I paid extra to have 20 kg checkin luggage and an onboard meal The total price was still reasonable and besides both flights were delayed a little bit all went good By the way don’t buy that option just for the meal because it was crap With lowcost carriers it is always a gamble If all goes well you travel cheap Once it goes bad you face pretty poor customer service However the few flights I did with Air Asia over the years have always been without any problems,Positive
I don’t know what the fast pass option is specifically but a lot of airlines will give you the basic option carry on only no extras and then a more expensive option with a checked bag and a few more extras you can select the basic option and then just add a checked bag so you’re not paying more for the other extras also if you don’t want them,Neutral
I found them fair priced Seats are tight Business class isn’t much more money and gets you into a nice free lounge for breakfast,Positive
Do not fly Air Asia at any cost its been 19 months and i m still waiting for a refund due flight cancellation There are no customer service agents or live human people working there to resolve an issue all AI useless poor serviceuncomfortable planes etc etc,Negative
everyone should boycott airasia Zero customer service and their CEO is a dick head Bought their unlimited flights literally a scam bullshit processing fees unbookable dates etc If you can please avoid Airasia,Negative
Agreed I bought their domestic flight buffet in 2020 which worked out great Now in 2022 this super subscription so far never ever gave me any availability and I have given up on it to the point of not booking Air Asia if possible,Negative
Air Asia is a horrible airline Always book your flight with them using a credit card and if they cancel dispute the charges Your credit card company will always refund you since they never respond It’s strictly a numbers game with them,Negative
Funny you should say that I tried using two different credit cards neither was accepted and then did the 711 over the counter payment so Im definitely fucked when it comes to a refund live and learn,Negative
Go ahead and ban me for not letting them steal my money,Negative
for some reason theres a lot of supposedly functioning western adults that have no credit cards,Neutral
they charge you for paying with credit card but yes the ability to dispute it is a great benefit,Positive
Vietjet are much better with refunds than Air Asia at least They make it easy enough to actually talk to someone too Getting a refund from AirAsia is a nightmare,Negative
Getting a refund from AirAsia is a nightmare Is it even possible They literally have no contact information on the website as far as I can tell,Negative
You have to use their Virtual agent in a very specific way then eventually it will let you open a ticket after like 5 days it will email you You have 7 days after your last contact to email them regardless of if they respond otherwise they will close your case ghost you and keep your money Once you have a case open they will do anything they can to delay the process or refuse a refund I managed to get a refund nevermind it was a credit that would eventually expire in April 2020,Negative
Those mofos screwed me voer 2 times Then proceeded to flasly lie about avoiding refind Almost missed my flight to Europe cause of them So during the past 8 months I rather wait 2 more hours for other domestic flights than to fly with them NEve again with Viet Air They moved my flight from 6 pm to 8 pm 1 day prior to flight THen on my way to airport they moved it to 9pm again I was at the airport already at 630 so when i asked for refunt they said that i had to be present 2 hours before the flight Which i wasas the flight was 9pm now and not freaking 8 I was refunding that one Scammers Just avoid them hope they go bancrupt,Negative
Usually if they dont have enough passengers they will cancel Its a low fare airlines,Negative
13 cancellations in 3 months is A LOT Are they all domestic flights Sounds like they’re in a deep shit no wonder they’re go all in with their super advertisements,Negative
That’s crazy What kind of recuperation they provide with the cancellation I assume they give you some free credit or something Also are you able to get compensation from your insurance,Negative
That doesn’t seem like a recuperation not even a hotel voucher And what happens if the new dates doesn’t work,Negative
They dont seem to give refunds and they will do everything to delay it,Negative
Good for you I am still down 500 bucks even after managing to talking with a person in person AirAsia is a thief trash company end of story,Negative
They have had plenty of opportunity to issue a refund once you get there you will know lol,Negative
Yup They didnt book my ticket and still waiting for that unsuccessful bookings refund Seems like the refund itself is unsuccessful at this point,Negative
Ive been waiting 13 months for a refund so dont count on getting a refund anytime soon,Negative
Yeah I know what you mean I once flew with my wife and some friends in a group of eight people and they wouldnt let me carry on a bag that weighed 63 kg I mean that was 1 whole kg below the weight allowance for the group Not very bright s,Negative
I was joking hence the s I was trying to point out what would happen if people flying together were allowed to pool their carryon weight allowances,Neutral
I didn’t purchase a prebaggage allowance because I didn’t know that that was what I was supposed to do and so 44k of bags between two passengers was 500 Fuck air Asia,Negative
When I was checking in the auto bag drop machine had an error and included weight of the tray into my luggage allowance which I had packed and weighed to the tee and they refused to rectify it saying the machine is accurate and gave me attitude cuz she was forced to limp from the Air Asia desk to the bagdrop machine while her fellow colleague was doing something unimportant on his mobile phone and so they wanted to charge me for the overallowance of 3kg for 90 Luckily when I went to the assistance counter the lady not air asia staff was kind enough to waive it off,Negative
Operational bullshit,Negative
AirAsia has been known as a shady money grubbing corp for a number of years now With a mega douche CEO to boot Pay the extra and avoid them By the time they hit you with all their extras its not much of a difference anyway Also there are a ton of intangibles such as many cancelled flights almost always going through Don Meung luggage fees that are a pain in the ass to pay that just make it not worth the savings Do you still need to get out of line and walk a receipt over to another counter pay you luggage fees and then walk back to the check in counter I never use them anymore but I remember thinking who the F runs a business this way Then I saw that infamous Zoom call the CEO made oh thats who,Negative
Totally different airlines,Neutral
Im still waiting on a refund from a ticket I bought in 2020,Negative
They periodically email me to encourage me to accept a flight credit instead of a refund I have no desire for a credit so Ill hold out for the refund but Im not expecting them to cough it up I wont use them again regardless,Negative
Its essentially impossible to chase they have no contact information on their website,Negative
Ive done just that and the CS personnels promised me the cash refund They lied The chatbot has been updated now so you wont be able to bruteforce through As far as I know AirAsia doesnt even have CS anymore,Negative
If we could track down other passengers and build up a case thatd be ideal,Neutral
2020 was the pandemic they wont refund it I only got credits with an expiration date even though the CS promised me cash refund,Negative
I’m not saying anything against Air Asia because of some draconian libel laws but I’ve always preferred to fly domestically with Nok Air Any cancellations by Nok have always been met with tickets the next day or a van ride to my destination,Neutral
In late 2020 or early 2021 cant remember Air Asia cancelled our tickets for a domestic flight They put up a new flight 5 minutes shy of the first one but refused to reschedule us for that one It was crazy expensive so we ended up going with Smile instead Still waiting for a refund,Negative
AirAsia The flight that caused me to get deathly sick from shivering all night in their cold ass cabin They have blankets but they’re 150 baht rental and they don’t accept cards Accept fucking cards AirAsia,Negative
Interesting are those flights domestic or international Ive had some domestic flights with them rescheduled by a few hours in the past few months but none canceled Its always a bit luck of the draw when it comes to rescheduling and with any airline I dont think AA is particularly affected,Positive
I had both domestic and international flights canceled and rescheduled on AirAsia It seems so frequent at this point Id not rely on them for a connection or a timesensitive trip eg to a meeting Never happened to me on any other lowcost airline in the region VietJet Lion Malindo Nok though Im sure they do it occasionally too,Negative
Something might have been changed I recall usage of AirAsia 46 years ago and it worked pretty well actually,Positive
I literally just booked a flight with air Asia to Phuket from bkk How fked am I,Negative
Probably totally unfked If the flight is soon youre probably fine If youve booked something with any carrier for March 2023 or later then Id say nobody knows,Neutral
A lot of airlines are Cancelling flights,Neutral
Yea the airline world is a different beast now puttingoff flying as long as i can,Neutral
I’m on a air Asia flight now domestic no issues,Positive
You will get what you paid for Low cost low customer service Low cost low reliable,Negative
Air Asia canceled my flights when the pandemic first started They refused to give refunds I had to drive to the office and still they would only give me points that could be used for your next Air Asia flight Every other Airline gave me a refund when borders started closing,Negative
Air Asia cancelled my flight then rescheduled the exact same flight but 600 more and still no refund,Negative
Not air Asia but similar experiences here in Australia this year I fly a lot for work and in the first half of the year there was hardly a flight that was wasnt cancelled or delayed Things got better in the last half of the year but still not perfect I think during COVID all airlines laid off staff and now can not replace them quick enough I just got so used to spending hours in lounges that it almost became normal Lucky for me I fly at my employers expense so I was never personally out of pocket waiting for refunds a big tip is never purchase the cheap flights always pay for a fully flexible fare,Neutral
Yes it happened to me cancelled my Jan 17 flight BKK to Syd and moved it 5 days after spent hours on the phone and customer service bot all for no change,Negative
Worst airline in the region I had 3 flights cancelled in 2020 due to covid and Im still waiting for my refund,Negative
Agree with most of you At this point Id rather take a boat or train back to Europe even than AirAsia SX,Negative
2 and 3 is basically every lowcost airline and even some legacy carriers You should be glad you even had a IFE system What were you seriously expecting Youre basically described every lowcost carrier,Neutral
They have in flight entertainment Worst which other airlines have you flown,Neutral
Perhaps you should learn the difference between low cost and full service airlines No low cost airline provides food or drink free bags free seat assignments and all have very little room between seats since they cram as many seats in as possible Ive actually not heard of a low cost airline having a in fight entertainment monitor Thats extremely rare You choose to book the cheapest ticket Its cheap because of all of the above They also have very limited customer service In fact Im surprised you could call and speak to a customer service agents Most save money by only using online bots If you want free amenities next time spend the more money to book a full service carrier,Positive
its not the problem of cheap ticket people need to know what they are getting in to i forgot to mention that i travel quiet often on business trips and the fucking airasia was the only option available for me that time i have been traveling to SEA countries every two months low cost doesnt mean it become a third world country bus in the air,Negative
Counter point I’ve never had any issue with air Asia Thailand,Positive
Its a low cost airline so yes you pay for food and many other services like seat selection unless you buy a premium pack The booking process might have been glitchy but you seem to have actually purchased a ticket which was the important thing Baggage allowances are on their web site home page very hard to miss Sane with seat selection a very clear description of what the options are Flight delays are usually communicated in the App Yes some airport announcements arent exactly clear and departure board times sometimes dont get updated Im wondering why the terminal lights got turned off though That wouldnt be the airlines fault Ive flown on AirAsia a few times and they are a typical low cost airline But I had quite low expectations and they were exceededI thought their food was quite good,Positive
AirAsiacom sucks For most Asian discount airlines I use Tripcom to book Trip is reliable for Asian budget carriers such as AirAsia I can buy luggage through Trip AirAsia itself is a reliable budget carrier I’ve flown them dozens of times and I’ve found them to be dependable The biggest issues I’ve had have been weather related I find them to be upfront about what you get If you buy a 40USD plane ticket you gotta assume there is a catch 29 inch seat pitch no food and 7 KG of cabin baggage is that catch,Negative
It took them 2 years to refund our money from our cancelled flight during COVID Thats enough for me to never fly with them again,Negative
Good luck getting your refund with them They make it hard as possible and probably denies it on arbitrary reason and if you luck out they give you points It is low cost airline so dont expect them to treat you like premium air companies do I had once tickets with them which wanted to transfer or cancel months before and they made it impossible and took like 1 month to answer email I just gave up,Negative
Bo is a pain but sometimes if you change the words youre using you can get it to do something different However Ive never known AirAsia to provide actual refunds where the cash is returned to your credit card Youd probably only get credits to use on a different flight But realistically you should save yourself the agony and just plan on buying a new ticket,Negative
Yeah airasia dont do refunds only credit,Negative
Good luck I once had to wait over 4 months just to get back money they double charged me,Negative
Thanks everyone Lesson learned If I had of changed the flight before the 48 hours I only would have been out 18 I just rebooked and ate the 200 return flight Im not getting anywhere with AirAsia and cant waste any more time or energy on it Plus waiting is only driving uo the costs on the flights as the dates get closer and theres the song kran holiday right now where everything is busy,Negative
i atew 72 dollars todsay they are son of bitches tbh,Negative
Fwiw this happens with every low cost carrier in Asia Its also why their flights are 35 But its known in order to get help with Air Asia you have to go in person,Neutral
Ive flown with Air Asia dozens of times and its always been alright Most of the flights Ive taken with them are 150 or less so if things get fucked up its not a big deal to me,Positive
Yeah basically Airasia is only useful for issues within SEA and not outside like in Australia It is ridiculous I am having a few issues with them I will not get what i need out of them so I will just have to chalk it down as a win for them But I expected that,Positive
Thanks Luckily they fly out of my city’s airportBBI I mean they have a check in counter at the airport I will go talk to them tomorrow morning Hopefully I will get the refund too,Neutral
I did and they transferred me to 7 different people every single one telling me they couldn’t do anything Even though I expressed repeatedly I didn’t get what I paid for,Negative
Chatbots are the bane of modern customer service Absolutely refuse to use them for anything real and insist on calling or talking to a human Ironically when I was in tech years back it was the cool new thing and now it’s shittier than ever,Negative
Cant help you as I dont fly that frequently to know anything Just pointing out your mistake is probably to ask for refund of AAs mistake so they proceed to cancel the flight that they can refund on,Neutral
Yeah that is my current assumption It is frustrating because 1 I followed their instruction 2 if they actually canceled my flight then they should have sent an email to confirm that they have canceled it instead of sending me the itinerary that I have successfully booked and is ready to check in,Negative
AA is a known scammer btw Use something else next time and lower your expectations for a refund here Complaints and emails and calls is all you could do Maybe go to their booth for this issue,Negative
He mentioned that this is the only flight available for his schedule I dont think this is a scam lol this definitely can happen to any airline and I suspect it could be a mistake from some junior executive or a system glitch,Positive
and im saying i simply dont trust the data they put out but i will take a look,Negative
I am not sure why you refuse to trust the data Cirium a reputable website on aviation analytics also vouched AAs recent OTP performance This data have to be submitted to MAVCOM to be audited anyway its difficult to fake the results since they can easily be vouched to the dataset collected by the airports themselves,Positive
well put it this way Trust has to be earned it is not a given And airasia has a LONG history of dishonest and ethically dubious practices over the years So i would not put it past them to use creative statistics to show the results they want My instinct is to mistrust anything said by Airasia plain and simple anyway like i said ill take a look at the data,Negative
Giving them the benefit of the doubt is one way to view this Not when they do this repeatedly Simply google it It would be a lengthy story to explain what my gf went through with them which makes me bitter with them,Negative
In his recent comment he mentioned that the staff informed him that they had raised a ticket for his issue and he should get refunded within 10 working days The same goes with the points he used to help discount the ticket I think the comment made by the staff is reasonable I dont think there will be issues with refunds now compared to the COVID period back then given AA is nearly running at full capacity with positive cashflow,Positive
There is no email address for them It’s intentional that way so that you only can go to their stupid AI chat bot Bo,Negative
Ask them to transfer the payment credits to the 2nd booking Do not accept the refund because their refund policies are also a scam I doubt you will actually get the money returned to your credit card Instead they will give you something worthless like vouchers Batik Air is also not great While cheap and better service that Air Asia they too have poorly trained customer service and ground staff but more improtantly are part of the Lion Air group which has a horrible safety record Also Batik Air is often late but since you are flying Air Asia I guess you dont care about that haha If youre flying Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur next time stick to ANA or Malaysia Airlines,Negative
Can vouch for this I got refunded credit account and it’s a credit account with expiry date Screw air Asia,Negative
If you gave the booking ref code there is no way it would cancel the wrong booking unless their chatbot is full of sht Unless you only provide your name which then is not the mistake since it has to cancel 1 of them But again even if you gave only the name but both booking is on 2 different flight number and you specifically let the bot know which flight number you want to cancel there no way this could happen unless the cancellation is done by an agent behind the chat bot and they have no idea what they are doing,Negative
Write in a formal complaint Should their response be unsatisfactory or lack of response write to MAVCOM I had a dispute with Malaysia Airlines and the moment I wrote to MAVCOM they shat their pants and prioritized my issue right away They said itll be refunded and took about 2 weeks,Neutral
Your first mistake is flying with AirAsia,Negative
flew air asia once never again,Negative
Update as predicted by some here AirAsia said that they would transfer my money back as Credit Account I declined and asked them to send money back to my card It is really disappointing that they still try to take money from me again after this,Negative
It worked for me 2 years ago not sure about now If you want to get their attention spam them on twitter with your complains and bash them about their robot customer support They will get scared and reply you,Neutral
I went to AirAsia Sales Centre KL sentral to get things sorted Maybe u can do the same,Neutral
Oh yes You are right Just woke up and still blur But yeah probably there are some AirAsia Sales Centre that heshethey can go to in Japan Just telling how I got mine sorted out Either the Sales Centre or go to the Sales Counter in the airport,Neutral
I’ve flown Air Asia several times and never had an issue FYI Asia is not a country so there are no “states”,Positive
Its all good Ive used it 34 times and never had any problems Watch out for Indigo though They’re truly a mess and moved my flight back and forth like 5 times But in the end they were very accommodating They let me pass security controls when boarding was almost over so I made it on time,Positive
I just took air asia domestic flight twice in two weeks and both flights been delayed The later one was delayed for an hour,Negative
AirAsia is pretty famous among travellers in South East Asia looking for cheap flights No problem whatsoever However the inflight service and the checkin luggages are not free of charge,Positive
You will get better prices if you book several weeks in advance in my experience 3 weeks ahead is enough or during specific promo periods However even if booking just a few days ahead AirAsia fares will usually be reasonable better than the good fares on regular airlines Do beware of peak periods though Thai holidays with 3day weekends etc In addition consider Thai Lion Air and Nok Air as AirAsia theyre generally not listed at agencies like Orbitz or Expedia you need to book on their website,Positive
Buying tickets online is very irritating with them Lots things you have to unclick at almost every page not to get charged more than the advertised price And in the end if I remember right they add on an extra 250 for your seat thats the minimum for an economy seat It wont be long before theyll be charging for toilet passes and air consumption,Negative
Its a budget airline but the service is perfectly fine Expect to be hungry and pay for checked baggage But if you want to fly short trips around asia theyre better than jetstar imo You can even easily change dates if you pay the fee,Positive
AirAsia served me an excellent meal London New Delhi Baggage fees standard allowed me a guitar as extra carryon free of charge,Positive
Yeah Ive only ever used them around SEA Never been on a long enough flight to bother paying for a meal,Neutral
For my budget Ill go as far as booking the day before hand if the urge takes me But the prices dont seem to change more than around 30 USD I might just be on a lucky streak though lol,Positive
You should manage Look at their website and see how much a flight to manila costs leaving tomorrow and see how much for leaving in a couple of weeks In my experience their prices are pretty stable,Positive
Theyve actually got really tasty onboard meals Youll save some baths by paying the meal while you book the flight Of course theyre a bit more expensive than on the street but theyre delicious and probably cheaper than on the airport,Positive
theyre better than jetstar imo Every airline on the planet is better than Jetstar Alan Joyces idea of Dantes Inferno,Positive
I was able to get an air asia ticket from Bangkok up to Chiang Mai for 45booked it 8 hours in advance All depends on how full the flight is,Positive
Its like a million times better than any US airline,Positive
No problems except for the seat charge but note that the web prices do not extend to inperson prices Also online your CC might not work with their site My debit card did and my CC worked at their inperson kiosk,Positive
I had horrible experience with airasia I wont tell all details because it still makes my blood boil but essentially I got to the airport and checked in 4h in advance I lost the flight and they made me pay a penalty to take another plane 2 hours later Airasia never again For budget tickets I go with Tigerair they are from Singapore,Negative
Their punctuality varies tremendously within the group they are actually a somewhat loose alliance of joint ventures with a common branding and booking engine rather than a single airline In 2013 Thai AirAsia was apparently the most punctual airline in ASEAN and the second most punctual in all of Asia,Neutral
yes is horrible,Negative
Make sure you check other airlines Very few of the AirAsia flights are cheap overall they are a ripoff You will find massively better service at similar prices with eg Bangkok Air or Malaysia Airlines Just check online,Negative
A good company keeps to their motto the company colours thats distinct and company name Dont know whats up with Mr Tony but it seems they are like a headless chicken that doesnt know which directions to cluck to,Negative
Agreed this is just unbelievably stupid They had a strong branding one of the strongest brands in ASEANhttpsbrandirectorycomrankingsasean why throw that away and confuse consumers like this I get that they are trying to move into this super app nonsense where they arent just an airline but their app is terrible Its the worst thing about AirAsia they are a generally competent airline no frills and no customer service but cheap and on time they think Im going to go to that disaster of an app over Grab or FoodPanda Not going to happen I cant even use the app to book flights,Negative
everything old goneincludin old refund old debt,Negative
I just hope they improve their awful app The AirAsia app and website were so bad and slow,Negative
This rebrand is yuck is it part of Grab Similar colours Whiever did this has trashed a perfectly good branding the app was pretty shit though,Negative
Their marketing department seems low on budget or have none at all Theres no brand promotion awareness or sales to hype this app up I mean I remember when foodpanda were giving away physical coupons to spread brand awareness,Negative
I am now also confused when looking for AirAsia specific flights When I try to book on their AppWebsite I am getting fares from competing budget airlines as well What happened to them,Negative
Worst Rebranding Ever httpspreviewreddite97ymn001gmd1jpegwidth1000formatpjpgautowebps02e67d4b206cf970f2d0cda91649e1b44226af6a,Negative
I cant believe that an entire group of people at all levels of the AirAsia organisation thought that this retarded attempt at a rebrand was a good idea Further evidence that money cant buy brains not common sense,Negative
Only time I used them was Auckland Phuket via KL Leaving Auckland they checked everyone in then with no communication just left everyone waiting for hours with no plane appearing At least 3 hours passed after the plane was meant to depart with vague rumour of delay before they eventually announced around 1am that everyone should go get their bags again as theyd cancelled the flight Mayhem as everyone tries to work out what to do about connecting flights etc AirAsia staff all clueless Eventually someone with a lanyard calls out to the crowd that there will probably be a flight later in the morning but no idea when You could wait in the airport to find out or go home and wait for a text message Another AA staffer said dont count on a flight though best go home If you were from out of town they had a small number of rooms they were offering at the hotel over the road but first in first served Mad scramble Some word but no firm commitment from the AA staff that taxi fares may be covered to leave and come back just try deal with AA support later on Got home lay down to get some sleep then within a few minutes got a message to come back to the airport for a 5am flight Race back to the airport Once in the air realised the paid meal add ons were all binned due to the flight delay so no one got any food On arriving in KL AA staff were still useless about confirming connections and only just managed to get us information at the last minute to avoid missing it Returning from Phuket was gladly unremarkable Food was terrible so didnt miss much the first time Took about a year of dealing with AA customer support to get a refund for the missed meals and taxi fare Only after hassling them publicly multiple times on social media did they make any effort to respond but still went silent multiple times They clearly use exhaustion by frustration as a tactic to avoid payouts If you do fly with them just be prepared for a complete clown show if anything doesnt go exactly to plan You may be lucky but theyre cheap for a reason,Negative
Theyre a low cost carrier Dont expect full service and youll be fine,Neutral
Yeah They’re the easyJet of Asia Get you thereish on timeish at less cost than the more established airlines but don’t expect food and god help you if anything goes wrong,Neutral
Ive really enjoyed flying with them on shorter flights up to about 3 hours Never had an issue Understand that you need to pay extra for certain services and that low cost carriers generally dont bend the rules and youll be good,Positive
I used them back in around 2017 for Japan to NZ They were very cheap but had to fly JPN Malaysia Australia NZ so took much longer than usual I seem to remember I had to pay extra for everything such as meals entertainment etc and the seats weren’t very comfortable at all When I looked at them recently the prices were much higher and I wouldn’t consider them again for anything further than Australia especially when not much difference in price to bigger carriers offering more direct flights of higher quality I did get a chicken curry and roti on the flight though that was great,Negative
Ive flown Malaysia to Chch way back in about 2010 and they were fine Just dont expect anything other than the basics of getting you from A B,Neutral
I think you also have to pay extra for checked baggage and meals so you might need to take that into account,Neutral
Ive flown them a lot having lived in Malaysia for years Ive also flown Singapore Airlines a lot when AirAsia canned the route for a period of time The main point is you cant find anything cheaper not even close to flying Auckland to KL if youre trying to be as cheap as possible 459 dollars is the standard price if you book far enough ahead and not across Christmas period where it goes up to a whopping lol 700 and change When you buy the extras for a meal some of the best meals for cheap shitty airlines get the Nasi Lemak and bags etc it will be around 1600 return instead of 900ish Still the cheapest by far If I can avoid it I will never fly with them again though Theyre designed for smaller people than myself theyre lacking in basic items such as power outlets Their seats are abysmal Its a very successful very cheap carrier for a reason and they legitimately cut costs in a huge amount of ways I also wont fly Singapore Airlines if I can avoid it also as theyre the inverse where theyre overpriced for the quality of their product and Singapore itself is dull as hell imo AirAsia is the best for when youre in SEA as you can basically hop around for sweet fuck all but for their long haul service AirAsiaX its garbage but priced very well if thats what you need,Neutral
Yes Book seats or you will not be seated with the people you are traveling with,Neutral
Ive used them internally in Asia I thought they were very cheap and the qualityservice was good for the price One flight I had was cancelled they rang me personally and helped me rebook new flights for me and the family,Positive
I did but it was pre covid I mean it’s no thrills but I had no issues,Positive
I wouldnt mind flying with air asia but I tend to prefer either citilink or batik air,Neutral
Doesnt Airasia have multitude of cancelation problems lately As in they wont fly a scheduled flight until it reaches a certain number of booked passengers If its not reached they sell the passengers to other flight So the booking time becomes wildly different sometimes it is moved to a different date and sometimes it is cancelled just a few day before the flight date which makes a rebooking an issue with remaining seats left and jacked up prices compared to booking a few months earlier Note that this is not a personal experience but a second party information,Negative
Screw them I had a bad experience with them cancelling flights or delaying multiple times within a single flight Also somehow they wont refund my money and it became Credit Account that i wont be using,Negative
Tbh plane crash is unlikely in general this includes AirAsia But I try to avoid it as much as possible because of reliability concern Ive had bad experiences where flights got delayed with them before which mess up my itinerary,Negative
airasia is one of the safer ones but contrary to other airlines even to other low cost airasia doesn’t offer free checked baggage,Neutral
It is completely bullshit if they say they will contact you I have been given promises like this many times and to date i have not gotten a single email or call from them They always ask you to go talk to the stupid chat bot of theirs that doesnt solve anything,Negative
Sometimes people had to choose AirAsia because of flight timing differences,Neutral
I kena played by AA just recently 25th Nov to be exact Entered AA website but got redirected to AirPaz instead Called AA to confirm and yes they say they let AirPaz handle their bookings for the moment Got my tickets luggage seatings from AirPaz just to not be able to check in on the 23rd because my itinerary is not existent on AA records AirPaz not picking up calls AA not taking responsibility In the end on the 25th morning 2hours before my flight I finally checked in with my boarding pass sent to an anonymous email address FUCK AA and AIRPAZ,Negative
Wait You manage to call AA and talk to human Whats the phone number Put here so we can all benefit,Neutral
Lol I got left for dead by Airasia in the start of the pandemic yeah i know most ppl dont care about covid now but it was beginning and no1 knows wats gonna hit I was at Korea during the initial outbreak They cancel my flight and didnt even replace it Just cancel and credit no flight home I had to book 1 at 5 times the price to go home Chase them down for an explanation to no avail Contacted mav comm or wateva it was The gov thing They didnt care say i must get a reply from AA 1st Guess what AA will just ignore u Lol Its like they r working together,Negative
One of the biggest legal scammer in the country,Negative
To be honest i think international flights are not so bad I think this is because of how airports are much more strict overseas with their schedules or else hefty fine can be fined to AA,Neutral
The cancellations I’m not so sure but the delay could be due to many factors tbh Lots of variable at play with air travels,Neutral
Yes But if every single flight gets delayed and it can happen 3 months before the flight time is dodgy no Furthermore people pay extra for flights with good timings,Negative
Its refunded but took a cut though would it still be possible to dispute for services undelivered given thats the case,Negative
Flew AirAsia around 3 weeks ago both ways klpenang nothing out of ordinary,Positive
Online with app I usually buy tickets 1 month in advance for the lowest price I think it was GrabPay,Neutral
i think so too that this is apparent in off peak low volume flights and aa uses its system to maximize cost effectiveness its not ethical but am told that similar systemmethod is also being used in across eu low cost carriers,Negative
Yeah I mean ive got friends affect by it la And many say the plane just never arrived,Negative
Yeah Cut throat and really just not consumer friendly Id go as far to say it is against most consumer rights but i think it is also in thee TnC,Negative
Just flew AA KL to Langkawi and back Nothing out of the ordinary,Positive
Full flight on Tuesday afternoon which is a very good sight It was uneventful,Positive
Fuck airasia I will never fly with them again Keep delaying my flight Rather use malindo MAS Also everytime AA do some promotion I never find the said promotion when i try to make a booking online Such a big scam,Negative
Malindo is shit too bro Gave me my refund back in the form of a voucher worth rm400 not a small amount of money for me and when I try to redeem said voucher it said that it has already been in use Emailed them and no answer called them but didnt come to any conclusion whatsoever too So they basically scammed me,Negative
I really think AirAsia is just pulling a corporate scam to get a few more ringgit before the execs cut and run Everything about the Facebook page and the app is just wayyyy to automatic and perfect No full flights no seat unavailable ect Even peak travel time for Hari Raya they are completely available for flights and slightly cheaper prices than competition Go to the airport and look around no AA staff no jets outside of storage just empty,Negative
I said fuck crapasia 67 years ago and never flew with them since then What triggered me was their double standard policy when they did not say anything about my carryon weight at klia2 and got charged for the same weight at lgk airport Fuck them to hell,Negative
Many airlines are doing same shady shits like this using covid19prepostpandemic uncertainties as an excuse I have a flight pending with MAS that has been delayed since end of January till now and no updates on it Cant refund but is given a free date change valid till March 2023 Another 2 separate flights that are delayed for almost a month which I just recently flew recently,Negative
Last week I flown in Air Asia from Kota Bharu to KL Seems fine for me Maybe Im lucky but who knows,Positive
It isnt just with AirAsia My flights on MAS as well as Malindo air gets cancelled and they move me to different flights as well For example 3 weeks back I had a flight to Singapore in the morning but it got cancelled and I got moved to an afternoon flight Similar with my flight tomorrow to Langkawi got cancelled in the morning and moved to afternoon My friends flight as well got moved,Negative
its not just AA someone i know booked with MAS got delayedrescheduled to absurd dates and no refunds,Negative
Well Im flying back to Penang with them on the 2nd Ill let you know if anything weird happens,Neutral
Recent Good Friday round trip SGKL The KLSG leg I think fully booked Nothing usual,Neutral
Based on my flightradar24 app Its been pretty active Theres 16 flying in MY airspace at the time of me typing this,Neutral
Havent flown in a while so not sure flight wise A pity their year end is June so itll be a while before we get the 2022 audited FS But looking at the 2021 audited FS of Airasia X Bhd it honestly doesnt look that good Big loss most of the non current assets fully impaired ady huge current liabilities though mostly provision for termination and very little cash reserves But then again June 2021 also was MCO time so hard to tell one,Neutral
same like malindo they wont refund your money their solution is to use before december 2022,Negative
My sister just kena Flight kena rescheduled no refunds and hotline nobody pick up She swore will never fly AA again Tony Fernandez is biggest scammer since the NajibJho Lo tag team,Negative
Poor airasia from the world’s favourite budget airline to a company hated by Malaysians MAS don’t deserve to live but have been given a second chance not by being good but by the trashiness of airasia,Negative
Does Fernandes know about this issue Or perhaps any acknowledgement at all that it is happening,Neutral
I just flew from from Alor Setar to KL nearly a month ago Honestly I can see that many flights were cancelled from Alor Setar Theres like only less than 20 flights that happened As for how normal the flight was it was pretty normal considering all things The flight was like 75 full,Positive
Had a friend fly Philippines Malaysia recently 2 way Got inconvenienced because they postponed the flight a day TLDR Same crappy service,Negative
Ive been using AA to fly domestically ever since Good Friday and from the 4 bookings I did with them 3 of them got rescheduled 1 of the flights got rescheduled 2 times from the original time of 235 pm to finally at 905 pm,Negative
Been flying monthly back hometown since last end of the year I say AA is returning based on the crowds at KLIA2 Now almost no where to hide at airport,Positive
Flew from Sabah to Kedah a few weeks back Nothing weird Seems pretty aok to me,Positive
Just last week I flew with Airasia,Neutral
I was there last Tuesday at KLIA2 Majority of the flights that day were AirAsia I supposed if anything they’re trying to increase flights but is hampered from other countries,Neutral
You really have to guess which flights are more likely to happen I almost booked a flight with them a few months after covid started But their flight schedules were almost like pre covid times which is not really possible in terms of frequencies Technically they will post flights and let you book even though they know its not going to happen Decided to go with Mas instead,Neutral
they cant show they only have 5 fights in a day instead theyll show 24 flights then cancel the other 19 and send customers on those 5 flights its the convenience store logic it doesnt matter if the produce are expiring and thrown away most importantly the shelves are full of it to look nice to customer,Negative
Flew to Kelantan a few weeks ago and then back to my hometown so idk what youre talking about,Neutral
AA and Mavcom are not in good term,Neutral
KL to Labuan with Malaysia Airline on the 12th and back with AirAsia,Neutral
My broken baggage claim is still being processed after 5 months,Negative
AA is just 1 giant scam am currently in a mavcom investigation with them for a 2nd time had a flight booking made whereby none of the flight details had actually been sent out in the email at all i just knew the day i was flying so showed up anyway only to be turned away AA has since refused to be contacted and it took another mavcom intervention to even get a peep out of them though i suspect the staff replying are probably filipinoindian as their reply windows are weird 7am most malaysians arent at work that early and on public holidays They are hellbent on refusing any refunds for their fuckups and have since even revealed a card that they probably shouldnt have to both mavcom they have the full data of any passengers mysejahteras movements and have threatened me with it which is sus af to say the least Fact of the matter is they are just 1 giant scam just 1 disaster away from closing down i reckon at the rate that theyre trying their hardest to hold onto any money they get even if its obtained illegaly,Negative
My flight for early July just 2 weeks to the flight has just suddenly been cancelled Horrible experience,Negative
I was so fed up with a chat bot that I wrote to it can I speak to a human please and it said I dont understand your question please choose one of these options Air Asias chat bot was one of the frustrating ones together with that idiot of a bot in lazada whereas I can understand that in some cases can help resolve a problem faster and save on operational cost companies that use them should allow for the call to be directed to a human and not when you are about to tear everyone of your hair out before you are allowed to talk to one as in what air Asia proposes to do,Negative
Tell me about it I had just checked my parents in on a flight and the person at the counter was so fucking rude and unhelpful gave us the wrong info then kept insisting it was correct I had to haul all the luggage myself onto the conveyor and I had to stick the fragile stickers and even the flight tag myself I immediately tried to lodge a complaint with airasia but the stupid chat bot was so bad at addressing the issues I had to specifically choose their complaints section which was buried deep in some menus and even now I haven’t heard anything from them despite being almost over a week since I lodged the complaint,Negative
FUN FACT If you repeat I want to speak to a person or anything similar tag word humanperson 4 times they will connect you to an actual person Like so httpsiibbco64hn3NwScreenshot20230330223946WhatsAppjpg I ignore and skip their useless chatbot completely all the time Edit this is for AirAsia,Neutral
Im not sure what you mean but I meant for Airasia,Neutral
It will soon back to square one as staffs quit due to low pay low headcount but high workload and high stress,Negative
Its too late never will I or my descendants spend a cent on Tony and his scams,Negative
I have been trying to find someone who is able to help with my query The chatbot was really bad,Negative
People are learning the hard way not to fly with Air Asia However once they have experienced this they will never fly with Air Asia again With such regular egregious behaviour the airline should be given a suspension EDIT Theres another case this time its Taipei to KL delayed 7 days Refer httpstwittercomweijie1404status1611319603149557761s20tUiJrR3L1UWVLza7HSayqA,Negative
Wow what the actual fck What is going on with AA,Negative
My brother works in AirAsia and he even complains how he doesnt get enough flights Could you imagine that AirAsia has workers complaining that theyre not getting enough work That company is definitely doing something shifty in the background maybe even preparing to close down and get liquidated and not because of bankruptcy,Negative
What else other than bankruptcy,Negative
Yup Not only that if AAX went into liquidation it would be nightmare for all the party involved especially the aircraft leasers The planes are gonna be grounded and arbitration would take long time before the leasers could take back the planes Also AAX has leasors and debtors spanning multiple country Its a clusterfck AirAsia X even uses other AirAsia group cash to refund some of their customer Famous case is Australian AAX customer being paid in vietnamese donghttpswwwmalaysianowcomnews20220608protestloomsatairasiahqaspassengersrefuserefundsinvouchercreditform equivalent to RM1700 she was owed RM5700 and the rest they gave her airasia credit which she cant use since AAX stopped operating in many countries,Negative
Wow now i for sure not gonna fly with AA ever again,Negative
MAVCOM is not doing its job AA should have their license suspended This is downright scammy behaviour,Negative
People know they are shit But people are also poor Cant fly SIA everywhere This couple will go back to Air Asia in a heartbeat Guaranteed,Neutral
Yea got layover usually 13 hours depending on the schedule Sometimes u can ask for earlier flight if available to shorten the layover Still will try my best to avoid AA Tony deserves to go bust,Negative
Sometimes the alternative just cost a little extra by rm20rm50 As what Ive always experience when dummy booking except holiday seasons Them still airasia Gets retimedcancelled due to operationa reason Faults airasia again rinse and repeat Its as if other airlines do not exist to them,Neutral
Apologies does not seem to be good enough without compensation for the extra expenses and then some more Imagine if they had to take extra leave and maybe even no pay leave because of someone elses problems that should have never occurred,Negative
They should be sued for compensation by all affected customers They are getting too big and too entitled,Negative
AirAsia should really reimburse them for the hotel and living expenses incurred over the extended stay I thought airlines were required to pay this out as soon as an international flight is delayed more than a certain number of hours,Negative
kalau the flight deferred more than 1 day bukan the airline needs to provide accomodations until the flying date Or got other clauses,Neutral
Yup Even if theres 3 hour 6 hour delays etc once it hits a timing threshold the airline is liable to provide passengers with certain things like meals and stuff like that But that being said its best to have your own travel insurance if possible incase the airline fucks up and doesnt take care of passengers the insurance can be used to stay at hotels and be properly restedcared for,Neutral
Does that apply to a low cost airline like AirAsia though I think not,Neutral
Things like this why I can see people justifying paying more for MAS,Neutral
MAS also does shady stuff like this except on a lower occurrence rate It aint like the good old days of early 2000s The only airline in Asean that still maintains some form of reliability and services is SIA as of 2018 Even Thai Airways Vietnam Airlines faced some quality degration starting in 2015 to compete against low cost carriers These stuff is already a normalcy in western countries since the 90s and is creeping into asia as we speak,Negative
To be fair though SIA is bigger so they needed all that bailout MAS after bailout really shrank their size to stop the bleeding AA seemed to hold their cards much later even using A330s for their domestic BKIKUL routes,Neutral
Wow That unacceptable and i hope that AirAsia need to compensate their passenger adequately and apologize to the affected passenger Mavcom need to make an example on this and fine AirAsia so they dont do it in the future,Negative
Yea I refuse to fly AirAsia especially when I travel with kids Imagine if it happened on the outbound journey Can burn your hotel fees and youll be lucky to get credit for your tickets if you decide not to take the flight,Negative
Adui I was waiting for AA to do MelbourneKL because I don’t want to do a layover in SG with Scoot I am flying next Sat I hope this doesn’t happen to me because I have limited days off,Neutral
Same I’m doing KLMelKL cuz it’s either 4k with AA or 7k with MAS,Neutral
AA should compensate the client since it is their error To apologise it cannot be accepted Just like given a slap on the face and apologizing No no no Couples need to fork out hard earn monies for their AA error Boycott AA Should teach them a good lesson until they improvise otherwise AA dont care at all Not only this couple previously I saw many times too Apologising no use Pay compasation is the best,Negative
Air Asia’s Tagline should be “Change is always possible”,Neutral
Shit like this is why Im hesitant to book any international flights with AA these days The only other feasible low cost carrier option is Scoot and I guess I can put up with a few hours layover in Changi Does anyone here have any experience flying with them and how was it,Negative
The thing is all airlines are required to compensate you with money and a room Even if its a cheap ticket Air Asia is blatantly breaking the rules with no fear of repercussion,Negative
AirAsia if theres a hole in the rules I squeeze my ass in it,Negative
Airlines are required to compensate you with money and a room For a delay of 4 hours in this case Really Where does it say that,Neutral
From httpswwwmavcommyenconsumerflightdelayscancellationshttpswwwmavcommyenconsumerflightdelayscancellations If your flight is delayed or cancelled your airline will most likely need to provide you with compensation to help you get your travel plans back on track Depending on the nature of the delay or cancellation this may include meals telephone calls and internet access for delays of 2 hours or more hotel accommodation and transport for delays of 5 hours or more or when a stay becomes necessary or a full refund or alternative flight if your flight is cancelled The only exceptions occur during “extraordinary circumstances” including security risks or extreme weather which the airline could not have known would happen,Neutral
In this case the delay was 4 hours so AirAsia would not have been required to provide a room,Neutral
my AA flight to Miri was delayed one upon a time ago for 3 hours They gave us a whopper from burger king some peanuts and air kotak kecik it depends on the ground crew at that respective time i guess,Neutral
Yeah the other day my AirAsia flight was delayed for 3 hours and they gave us food not Burger King but it was their famous nasi lemak,Neutral
AirAsia We take you for a ride,Neutral
AirAsia Now everyone is DELAYED,Negative
AirAsia Pay first complain later,Negative
I got disembarked from a Singapore Airlines plane after sitting in it for 5 hours It sucks but definitely not exclusive to Airasia,Neutral
But how often and how they handle it is among the worst in the local industry,Negative
I think is airport problem not airline problem Never sat in an Airasia plane in Changi for more than 10 minutes,Neutral
Other airline would face the same issue Dont they tho I regularly get stuck in Scoot planes in KUL as well and also waiting for family members stuck in Qantas Singapore airline planes in KUL Just to name a few,Neutral
Air Shit you expect this cancellation and delays on alll flight refund is credit to buy ticket back with them to get same issue if your flight success is rare occasion,Negative
AirAsia quality is bad right now definitely won’t use it tbh,Negative
Ive used MyAirline a couple times Price is very similar to AirAsia but they actually seem organised and flights leave on time The one time they announced a flight was delayed by 20 minutes It genuinely was delayed 20 mins on the dot No BS they were very apologetic Genuinely been quite impressed with them so far,Neutral
AirAsia Welcome back gifgiphyyoJC2BlMMydcdBvgze,Neutral
Always has been,Neutral
AirAsia I keep the money You wait up to 8 hours,Negative
AirAsia sucks balls dude Better off with Batik Air lol,Negative
But its the only ball I can afford to suck on AirAsia passengers,Negative
Our Gov under 4 different iterations are still oblivious Well I dont think its strictly true I believe its a manifestation of Junckers Dilemma We are now in a quintessential vortex and it has too much shortterm pain to break out from So politicians being politicians they prefer to kick the can down the road for plausible deniability later Well soon be joining the likes of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka Lets see what August brings in terms of inflation,Negative
is it because the plane didnt get clearance from airport control to get a docking point sometimes this happened when some plane got delayed for not departing in time causing next scheduled arrival plane had to wait or reroute to next possible terminal dock door of the plane you are on delayed at departure airport n arrived beyond scheduled alloted slot this is why planes dont simply fly faster to reach destination unless they get clearance at arrival airport,Neutral
Not a valid point for me too cant even touch the front seat,Negative
How is too fast bad,Neutral
I paid for a 2 hour flight Im flying for 2 hours,Neutral
Point no 1 is true They always fly slightly faster compared to other airlines,Neutral
Not that I would fly with AirAsia in light of their recent shenanigans but point one is a positive Faster is always better,Negative
Just because you choose a cheaper operator doesnt mean you shouldnt get the service you paid for which in this case is a trip from A to B Thats the very basic expectation not being met,Negative
I dont have the exact data to proof my case but based on hunch from complaints I think its a known risk that you are more likely to have delays or cancellations with AirAsia So by purchasing AirAsia tickets instead you accept the inconvenience that may cause,Negative
this is correct lmao i also got delayed once but my ticket is literally only a hundred ringgit cant complain lol,Neutral
Yes So there was a technical situation with the plane It has been delayed Passengers get refunded or opt for a different flight Is that not satisfactory enough for you Sure there is inconvenience Who wants for this Neither operator nor passenger So whats your point again,Neutral
Lol I dont expect to be disembarked from a plane after sitting for an hour Whether its AK SQ or Timbuktu Airlines people will complain,Negative
OP is complaining on AirAsia and not that specific flight Even Qatar Airlines have delay sometimes due to technical issues lol AirAsia is well known for being delayed while also well known of being very cheap You choose cheap stuff then expect cheap qualities,Negative
MyAirline is cool 1 Big leg room 2 Punctual like if its says travel time 5 9pm it will fly at 5pm and arrive at 9pm 3 More staff at different points of travel If maybe the staff hospitality is a bit synthetic but I think with time the staff would soften up So far 4 times and no complain Leg room a big point imo,Positive
But u left shit right,Negative
Happened to me twice,Neutral
I stopped using AirAsia after so many delays just not worth the anguish,Negative
Why take so long,Negative
Better than getting disembarked midflight,Negative
AA is a scam Try to ask if someone managed to get compensation after buying a flight insurance,Negative
I bought a flight with them earlier this week and didnt have any issues,Positive
Yeah Ive booked a few flights lately too and no issue Might be on your banks end,Positive
I think the verification service they are using has a problem At least for us cards I tried 4 cards from two different banks Get the 2fa pop up and enter the number And it fails Tried chrome and Firefox and my phone Called my bank and they said they arent seeing any charges being made Ended up using different airline,Negative
I had a similar issue with them last year one payment looked like it didnt process website error and one did tried a couple of times In fact I got email confirmations for both flights and my credit card was charged twice It was impossible I tried everything trust me to contact them to fix this and explain that there was an issue with their site that resulted in double booking I had two flights booked for myself same destination day timeprobably the most expensive flight from Siem Reap to Bangkok Do not try multiple cards contact your cc as soon as it errors to make sure you werent charged It was failing at the payment verification stage My bank confirmed it was an issue with the airasia site not the bank I also booked multiple flights with them after and didnt have any issues,Negative
Credit card company wasnt able to recall after I phoned them an hour later Charge was taken already it took a couple days to appear on my statement Email with reservations came in within 1520min from bookingerrors You should phone your cc companies to see if you were charged they can see transactions instantly,Negative
Its been a few years since I bought tickets on AirAsia but IIRC I had to try a couple different credit cards until one worked I am American with US cards,Neutral
I had similar issues with them last 2 years then I stopped flying on this airline,Negative
Im having exactly this problem right now in August 2023 I had no problems in the past,Negative
I was on the flight a couple of years back from Perth to Kuala Lumpur where one of the engines exploded The one where the pilot asked us to pray for our lives over the intercom as we limped back to Perth while the plane was shaking like a washing machine This was about as terrible as terrible fights get and the way the airline treated us afterwards was unbelievably awful Id take an OceanGate sub to see the Titanic before ever flying with those shitbags again,Negative
I was also very interested in the investigation findings but could never find anything conclusive either What happened was one of an engines blades broke off due to metal fatigue and tore up the engine and everything else in the housing after it got sucked in The remaining engine blades continued to spin even though the engine was non operational and the imbalance caused by the missing blade caused the terrible shuddering which lasted nearly two hours after we turned back above Shark Bay Street after the incident It was very hair raising to experience to say the least Im not sure how serious it was at the end of the day but we were all convinced at the time we were going to die mostly due to the captain coming over the intercom to tell us he was as scared as we were and that our survival chances would be greater if we prayed Not really what you wanted to hear at that moment Heres a report from CNN httpsyoutube9UF4z56l2VQ,Negative
Omg how scary I have a really big fear of flying to the point I shake the whole time cry lol I’m going to be flying air Asia soon So happy to hear yous landed safe,Neutral
If youre on a tight schedule and you book budget no your not,Neutral
Theres always delays with AirAsia Flew with them two days ago Id never rely on them if youre transiting onto another carrier with a gap of twothree hours Also a big chance cancellations and rescheduling,Negative
Booked PER to KL in March for a July trip Each flight changed numerous times Drastically,Negative
Didnt they just win an award Altho not sure how much that means,Neutral
If you’re on a tight schedule why risk it with a carrier like air Asia,Negative
Thanks all I won’t book with them after hearing your experiences They’re a bit cheaper so I was just tempted if I could save a buck but I won’t risk it if it seems this consistently poor still,Negative
Just in case only make it a one way ticket,Neutral
Every single time Ive flown Air Asia the flights been delayed Once by over 4 hours,Negative
Pre covid we flew with them heaps of times melkl next destination and back never had an issue Have not flown with them since but have heard timing has dropped off significantly and that they are not great from Perth,Negative
Just flew to Bali Had 25 hour delay leaving and a 30min delay coming back In laws were on flight the next day was also delayed by 30mins,Negative
Flew to Bali from Perth on Air Asia a couple weeks ago and the flight was delayed by an hour It was late arriving and even later leaving I wouldnt trust them to make a tight connection but good luck whatever you decide,Negative
flew Air Asia in March this year outbound flight got delayed three times,Negative
My mate just flew with them and said never again,Negative
I flew Perth to KL today and it went perfectly landed 10 mins early smooth flight cheap and nice food,Positive
Was coming here to say the same flew Perth to KL almost 2 weeks ago with no issues at all arrived 10 mins early,Positive
One of my relatives flew from Perth was delayed over 15 hours First it was a small delay 30 minutes that turned into a couple of hours delay Wasnt until around midnight that they put people up in hotel rooms but you couldnt get any rest because they had to be back at the airport by 67am Major shit show all round from AirAsia I doubt you would be able to get a refund from AirAsia I heard from friends who fly them that they are still holding onto money received during COVID and that they have no intention of refunding,Negative
Tight schedule I wouldnt risk it All my experiences with them have at least a 30 min delay,Negative
All I can say for quality is you get what you pay for,Neutral
It depends on your tolerance of budgetness I suppose AirAsia presumably like other budget airlines gives you a seat economyclass spacing and for everything else you have to fend for yourself Inflight meals and snacks must be paid for either on the flight itself while stocks last or when booking the ticket Drinks must also be paid for including water As for customer service once you actually get on the plane you should be safe but if you encounter any issues with your tickets be prepared for a fullday runaround and paying even more to correct the problems I think you get a 15kg luggage allowance per person Personally for the sixhourplus flight to Japan Id splurge on something more comfortable if only because Id rather not start a trip with six hours of moderate to severe discomfort Last time I went with Delta and had few problems although since its a US airline like United flights to Japan are usually just transits over to the US and so security measures can get pretty ridiculous,Neutral
No luggage allowance Any luggage allowance must be purchased Problem of airasia from SG is that its always through KLIA2 not really a problem for me since I can just go home first Ive actually been to Tokyo on Air Asia and its pretty decent for a budget airline,Positive
For the price its not bad I have flown from Tokyo to Singapore several times and they brand it as AirAsia X There is a little more legroom than usual and each time I paid less than 200 SGD for the one way And yes luggage allowance must be purchased,Positive
Just took the same route recently It was okay except that on the way back we were delayed 7 hours at KIX reached KL at 1am realised they fucked up our baggage waited 2 hours at the baggage claim area for our stuff queued some more for a new flight back Luckily ours was the first flight out Other singaporeans had to wait extra 2 to 3 hours because their party was bigger and the flights to singapore were already full As a form of apology got handed 40rm macdonalds voucher After returning waited a month for the right document in order to claim insurance because of all the back and forth correspondence they took forever to reply and kept sending me the wrong thing Would i take airasia again Probably only for flights that take 3 hours max and is a direct My flight there was smooth but once your flight gets delayed and you miss your transit its pretty much hell But i guess maybe i suay Not sure how often airasia flights get delayed,Negative
It was okay No really though it was shit,Negative
Ahahaha Basically its okay if you dont get delayed,Neutral
I flew AirAsia a few times and feel thats its the best budget carrier around No frills but gets the job done Are you transiting thru kl,Positive
Ive only done Air Asia for short regional flights so I cant tell you for sure I like their service and online booking facilities so far and I find that their planes are cleaner and better maintained than say Jetstars However as with most budget airlines dont screw up the booking and hope for nothing like cancellations or delays because they are running a low cost service after all That said I think safety and comfort are among my priorities A reasonable fare I would pay but nothing more For a 6 hour trip I would definitely need to prebook food and drinks cheaper And if you are doing Tokyo I suggest you add in the cost of 2way check in luggage I suggest 20kg25kg but not more Please spare a thought for the luggage handlers and see if the difference is still worth it,Neutral
Ive taken the Air Asia X red eye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne Sydney which is about 8 12 hours and it wasnt too bad I paid extra for checkin luggage as well as the inflight breakfast which was actually rather tasty I may have paid extra to choose the seat as well cant remember I ended up sitting at the tail end where there are only 2 seats on either side of the plane and I was very lucky to be sitting alone I felt like these seats had more legroom than being squished in the middle with everyone else Youre not going to get the same frills as flying on a fullfledged airline like water anytime you want but it was surprisingly tolerable Helps if you take something drowsy so you can just sleep all the way P Also helps if you buy water at the airport after youve checked in Ive had friends whove snuck food onto the plane too if you dont want to buy the onboard meals Edit I went KULSYD not KULMEL oh god Im getting old,Positive
Its WAAAAY cheaper to fly from Malaysia to Japan KLIA to Osaka is like RM300 lol,Positive
Their brand new KLIA2 terminal opened only a few weeks ago I transited through there twice on the way to Tokyo and back to Australia Can say it was a definite improvement over their old LCCT terminal a lot more shops and restaurants Main point is no more walking on the tarmac Only issue is that there is a lot of walking Just the walk time alone from the arrivals to a departure gate is 2030 mins Others have said that they dont allow you to bring your own food Ive found they do well they never scrutinised the contents of my carry on bags and I took sandwiches and dry snacks like potato crisps chocolates etc Have taken more than 10 flights with them no dramas with food Note that this was all Air Asia X their long distance flight carrier And their default free baggage was 20kg per person Upgrading to 30kg cost 44RM per person or about 15 SGDAUD a good option for the return trip if you plan on doing a lot of shopping You just need to purchase it when you do your web check in Upgrading luggage at the check in counter costs more,Positive
Thanks heaps for your response Ive just looked back and seen that i booked it through Paypal from memory AirAsia had no fees doing it through them because I wouldnt normally do that I can dispute the charge through them so will give that a try Edit I only requested travel credit as that was my only option at the time,Neutral
Air Asia has purposefully closed all their phone lines So do not bother trying to call You can request the refund through theirwebsite as I did 17Mar I waited the 30 days they stated and then emailed them to request status No response Online the status simply shows as in progress I posted to their Facebook and Twitter and did receive response that refunds will take 1216 weeks Hopefully they are not bankrupt by July so there is actually some money for me to have Safest bet would be to dispute with your credit card PayPal But I dont want to spend the 60 mins on hold with Master Card,Negative
Hi any luck Its already been 2 years and my refund was still not credited,Negative
ady been 2 years and my refund was still not credited I got it from through credit card Will they still refund it even if it was bought 2 years ago,Neutral
From everything Ive heard about AirAsia I wouldnt count on getting anything and then be pleasantly surprised if you do,Negative
I did get a travel credit My flight was booked for April 13th and fell under the cancelation policy for a full refund to my credit card Tried processing a full refund and finally last week received a travel credit This was for 300 usd I did file a complaint with them on the AVA chat about 2 weeks ago because all I kept on receiving were thank you for your patience at this time emails Im annoyed they chose to keep my money and make me use them to fly when this is over I would not give up on getting at least a travel credit if you qualify for one Personally after I use this travel credit I am going to avoid them if possible,Negative
Air Asia is more reliable than VietJet both inside and outside of Thailand One thing to consider when flying the budget airlines is whether you have checked bags because the checked bag fees on budget airlines can sometimes make them as expensive as the cheaper mainstream airlines,Positive
Air Asia is better than vietjet,Positive
Air Asia any day over Viet Jet for overall reliability and performance,Positive
I had good experiences with both airlines But i prefer Air Asia and they are my goto airline for domestic flights and their app is pretty good and lists all the other airlines too which is a bonus,Positive
Statistically Air Asia is more on time But frankly I’d make my decision on ease of getting to the airport from where you are and timing In the grand scheme of things they aren’t that different Make sure you go to their websites and click all the way through to where you enter your credit card to see the real cost The first cost you see will not be what you pay Sometimes the full service carriers end up being about the same cost once you add things like baggage and a credit card fee,Neutral
Be sure to pre book for any bags you will need to check because we got screwed bad at the counter,Negative
Ive only ever booked AirAsia flights on AirAsia and I cant imagine willingly doing anything to make anything more convoluted and difficult,Negative
Totally fine Ive done it many times,Positive
Air Asia app is full of mistakes and bugs especially after the Covid19 pandemic After the pandemic their management and promotions are bad too Now you can sometimes find current prices cheaper than their whats offered earlier I dont trust them and I dont believe in their zero fare offer unlike more than 15 years ago but I guess you have no better choice if you want to fly with them,Negative
Hi all Many thanks for your input guys Booked flight via airasia app And it was cheaper than MakeMyTrip or any other third party app Will update this thread during the journey Regards,Positive
In case you havent already use Skyscanner in a private browsing window you might even find a bigger discount Regardless Ive booked many flights through the AirAsiaMove app its a nightmare to login sometimes but it wont be an issue,Neutral
In any case it is safer to simply buy the tickets from the Airasia directly than from a sketchy third party site like MakeMyTrip,Neutral
I would pay more for Malaysia Airlines FOR SURE But absolutely air Asia over batik ANY DAY,Neutral
This Flown on all of them multiple times AirAsia are a budget carrier in that they charge for every extra they can and customer support is impossible but otherwise good quality and new planes My usual issue with them is that theyre often changing flights and times after booking Batik are budget of the old and shoddy variety Malaysia are a proper airline and a class above AirAsia is not usually much cheaper if you buy the extras to check a bag food and seat selection,Positive
If those are the only two options you’ve decided then I would definitely say Air Asia,Positive
Compare Air Asia with the upgrades for a comfy seat and a decent meal to Malaysian Air Asia usually sells the extras pretty reasonably and makes it an overall decent experience,Positive
Batik and Air Asia are much of a muchness although Air Asia have wide body planes which are more comfortable for long haul If th3 price difference isn’t too much I’d go Malaysian,Neutral
Air Asia X would be my choice I think for a LCC they are very decent but just always keep in mind they are not a legacy carrier and its not quite you get what you pay for but just dont expect cabin crewing catering to your every whim with some outdated view on Asian service habits If youd rather save money to spend enjoying Malaysia while youre there nothing wrong with Air Asia X at all Theyre a leader in the area for On Time Performance,Positive
I flew Air Asia on a medium haul international flight a month or two ago just paid for extra leg room meal etc which are honestly really cheap overall price was still much cheaper than Malaysia Airlines but the flight was comfortable,Positive
Air Asia is fine The food is good,Positive
Air asia Batik air has been notorious for delayed and cancelled flights as of late Recently submitted refund ticket for cancelled flight on batik air and had to rebook my flight on air asia In hindsight flights might look cheaper on batik air but their checked baggage and other addons are more expensive compared to airasia,Positive
Don’t book with Batik we booked with them based on flight times but they’ve canceled every flight and made it a red eye I don’t think they even plan to have their flights just collect the bookings and roll them into the one flight they have at night We are fighting to get money back but it’s been months,Negative
Air Asia has the best prices both in fare and in add ons God help you though if you need to make any changes or have issues that need to be resolved by a human The AI help bot is all but useless and no number to call Scoot is competitive in fare but their addons are super expensive and they dont have the range of options provided by AirAsia eg quiet zone Either very rushed or extremely long transit times in Singapore I have not taken Batik to KL only KL to Sydney There are no separated zones in the aircraft at all meaning any sound is carried throughout the cabin The 15 hour transit time in Denpasar is a big joke We had to disembark walk halfway through the terminal q up and get our passports checked then walk all the way back to the aircraft,Positive
Air Asia for flatbed Batik for normal seat,Neutral
On my experience of Batik it has been late several times and I stopped taking it Air Asia is great and the app does the job Im sorry KLMY but Im scared of Malaysia airlines surely wrongly but still,Positive
AirAsia and Batik have worse fatal pilot error records than Malaysian airlines,Neutral
AA more reliable in terms of arriving on timenot cancelling their flights,Positive
Air Asia canceled my flights 4 of them So No Fuck air Asia,Negative
Not everyone will face issues during their travel Unless that person travel every weekmonth then the opinion will be skewed All airlines can face issues Choose the one with better customer service Not airasia definitely,Negative
I flew AirAsia years ago and flew batik recently I dont have any negative experience regarding Batik since there was no delay and I appreciate more leg room as a tall person For AirAsia I have met multiple delays so it wasnt that pleasant Going to fly AirAsia again this month so hopefully its not as bad as before,Negative
Is this before or after you mandatory have to pay AA carbon tax since their CEO does not know the meaning of CSR For the record I would not fly either one even if I was paid for it,Negative
Between the 2 Air Asia X for sure,Positive
Ive been looking in to this Check out Air Asiahttpwwwairasiacomotenhomepage It really depends on the day and where you are flying tofrom From what I have seen flights can be from 15 100 ish American Average is around 40 but if you are flexible with dates price can drop from day to day One note on Vietnam Ive noticed not a lot of places fly tofrom Vietnam so if you dont plan on returning to Bangkok you may not have very many options,Neutral
Check out lionair maybe airasia too,Neutral
AirAsiahttpwwwairasiacom They are a low cost Asian carrier based out of Kuala Lumpur I used them a few times when I lived in Thailand,Neutral
I have flown AirAsia Its cheap Its cramped Its nofrills But theyll get you to where youre going,Positive
I took Air Asia to Thailand and flew back using MAS during the Xmas holidays MAS food was way better and so were their seats feels cleaner and more ergonomic in my opinion plus they have charging ports on their b737s But do check MAS if you booked 10kg check in or 20kg check in The only reason to choose AirAsia over MAS is either MAS does jot fly there or directly or the AirAsia price is cheaper or timing Likewise to choose MAS over airasia is much simpler transit Since AirAsia might fly to a different airport Edit edited for spelling mistakes and grammar correction,Neutral
MAS and Malindo over AA any day,Negative
If you have some spare cash and don’t mind spending more I suggest MAS AA is just downright a scummy company,Negative
In terms of quality 1 MAS 2 Batik 3 Airasia x200B However AA has the most flight timings and also will be the cheapest If you are planning to check in luggage though the price might not be much different from Batik if its on sale x200B Bali only has 1 main airport Denpasar so it will be the same destination If delays is your worry I would recommend to pick a flight earlier in the day Delays tend to accumulate and its usually the later flights that get it the worst,Neutral
Thats the thing AA also has the earliest arrival which is 9am Batik at 10am and MAS around 145pm Batik was around RM175k after fees and MAS was around 22k so I feel like Batik isnt worth it when you can pay a bit more for MAS But then my problem is arriving a bit later lah for my second leg flight,Neutral
If difference is minimal between the price of the tickets then MAS Otherwise if its within your budget then MalindoBatik AirAsia is okay but its just that MalindoBatik and MAS seats are far more comfy and you get better legroom as standard and their meals are better too,Neutral
I would take MAS since you have another flight to catch AA is notorious for delays and Ive boycotted them for years now that I dont have to travel for work I always fly Batik Air too since I love the bigger seats and extra legroom plus luggage is included however they have limited planes and flight times so should a cancellation occur you may be pushed to fly the next day or so like the other commenter mentioned Dont be cheap be smart Make sure you allocate enough time for yourself for transit Immigration traveling to the right terminal checking in bag drops etc,Negative
if you have extra money and need extra luggage go for MAS if not any budget airline is ok,Neutral
Avoid AA,Negative
One thing perhaps not mentioned here is that MAS and Batik uses KLIA 1 whereas AirAsia uses KLIA 2 If you are planning to fly to UK the same day after returning from Bali my suggestion would be to prioritise your UK flight above all else ie reduce the chance of missing the UK flight to the minimum First of all MAS and Batik are less likely to cancel Secondly if you are flying any other airline to UK it would be from KLIA 1 anyway so transit is easier and faster,Neutral
Yes they are safe,Positive
Assume all airlines are safe unless they are Russian or North Korean,Neutral
